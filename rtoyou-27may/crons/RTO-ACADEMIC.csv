The ministry had earlier given the institute a rank of 82, allegedly because the IIEST authorities had not submitted their data within the set deadline.We are working on the process to make NIRF even better from next time. This was the first year, so there is scope to improve on our policies, which we are currently working on. Not only IIEST, but the rankings of two or three more institutes have changed or been elevated. Many institutes submitted their data late. This will not be allowed from next year,"" said an MHRD source.","P.O.Botanic Garden, Shalimar shibpur, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Botanical Garden, Area, Howrah, West Bengal 711103",033 2668 4562,"1. 2nd Oldest Engg.

But, students here get one hell of an experience of the hostel life, senior-junior relationship is something we learn to treasure and cherish.
Add to it the fact that it is the country's second oldest insti., the long list of golden achiever alumni certainly evokes a feeling of pride, and lots of age-old colonial buildings(still functional) including a runic graveyard, !",4,

2,Institute of Hotel Management,www.ihmctan.edu,"The Institute of Hotel Management, Catering Technology and Applied Nutrition, Mumbai, the first of its kind in South East Asia was founded in the year 1954 by the All India Women’s Central Food Council under the leadership of Late Smt. Lilavati Munshi. 

Late Smt. Lilavati Munshi with a band of courageous women which included Smt. Homi J H Taleyarkhan and Smt. Leela N Jog under the name of All India Women’s Central Food Council established a chain of Annapoornas (restaurants) throughout the country, but primarily in the metropolitan cities to prepare and sell economic but nutritionally sound snacks and foods.

The purpose was to improve the nutritional status of the average from a high cereal diet to a more balanced diet. The critical factor however was to find trained personnel to run these Annapoornas on a self-financing basis. Hence the birth of the training Institute - IHM Mumbai.

Hotel Management and Catering Technology was still a young discipline in those days even in the West, in fact, the school of Hotel Administration of Cornell University bifurcated from the Department of Home Economics as a separate faculty only in 1954.","Institute of Hotel Management, Catering Technology and Applied Nutrition

In our endeavor, we draw upon reserves of goodwill among the diaspora of our alumni, reputation among recruiters and potential students, and commitment of our faculty and staff to the institute. 



The future holds tremendous promise for the Institute. We look forward to being recognized as one of the premier management schools worldwide. To achieve this goal, the Institute is following a three-pronged approach: connect, nurture, and grow. We will:
 
- CONNECT proactively with the worlds of practice and policy, with academic work nationally and globally, with our alumni, and with the local community.

- NURTURE a high performance work environment by emphasizing and supporting a climate of autonomy, stretch, and team work.

- GROW our capacity, but do so in a thoughtful and strategic manner, aiming to have an impact commensurate with our ambitions, and ensuring that we maintain and upgrade the quality of our people and our experience.


These three strategic priorities - connect, nurture, and grow – therefore, are at the core of our effort to be a premier global institute of management that educates leaders of enterprises.","Indian Institute of Management

INDIA",9.478811981,"1. The intensity of the academic rigour at IIM Ahmedabad is not one of those old wives' tales. The pedagogy is completely based on case studies, and these cases give the student an insight into management ideas involved in running a small grocery shop to a big corporate firm. They are challenging and daunting, and the decisions you are forced to make built or destroyed corporate empires. They make you think, they make you sweat and they make you introspect. They prepare the student for the real world.

It is not just the things you learn at IIM-A which makes the difference. It is the way those things are taught. One day you will have all the time in the world and on another you will find yourself with a short deadline for virtually impossible tasks, ranging from a dozen assignments to numberless quizzes. You are taught to survive in a realistic managerial atmosphere even when you are only learning what it takes to be a CEO one day.

The faculty at IIM-A are the very best in the country, and having handled the best minds in India every year through and through, they know how to keep us on our toes. Their research credentials are impeccable, and each faculty has his/her own approach to introducing management concepts, which makes everything all the more interesting.",4,
,,,,,,"2.Most of the acads rigor is only in the first year where there are so many courses and pop-quizzes. But overall, the curriculum is quite manageable, in fact it gives ample time to pursue your interests. No lectures post 1 PM during your first year means that you have the remaining part of the day for assignments, group activities and preparing for the next day. Second year is a little more relaxed (if you want it to be). Assignments are more fun assuming that you choose courses that you are interested in. Faculty seems a bit more relaxed (some were deemed very strict during our first year, but I personally have never faced any issue) Faculty members are excellent and very understanding.",5,
,,,,,,"3.The academic schedule at IIMA is pretty rigorous and trains us to think on our feet. The entire curriculum is case study based which gives us good insights into what had hapened in the past and what are the current trends in the industry.

,,,,,,"2. The best part of IIIT A is the course structure which is very compact. Unlike other colleges, we don't have Chemistry in the First Sem and even Physics is not there in the Second Semester for IT students. This gives the students a great amount of time to work on what they love.

    We have to  submit assignment problems via an ONLINE JUDGE from the first year itself thus making students familiar with these things at the very beginning.

What I mentioned above is in reference to faculty status. There is lack of good faculty.

The bud is going to bloom, naturally. A child has it all within, he or she will become a musician or a painter, another Einstein or Aryabhatta needs no one to tell. At the Golden International, the very belief in uniqueness of every child makes education a natural process. The focus here is on developing an individual vision for every child considering the inert potential, and then creating experiences for the child that will help achieve the envisioned objective without burdening the child with the task of earning knowledge. The challenge is to create that nature of learning environment where children grasp as much as they can from the outside world and yet not lose their originality. Towards this end the school has applied a modest approach. Though a lot has been done to ensure that a child gets everything here that goes into creating the right learning environment, the focus is completely on the central philosophy of nurturing the child in the most natural way.

The Infrastructure and list of facilities are mere means to facilitate the natural process of imparting education. Like a sports field is not only used to teach Football,or play cricket but also to explain some conceptual mathematics of speed, distance and time.The classes are spacious and ventilated,but this is just one part; what's more important is that classroom teaching is done through art, music and poetry;which really helps children in learning their lessons,naturally.","Rau-Rangwasa, Cat Road Indore Madhya Pradesh","0731-3256648,

They have their office hours,  they rarely refuse even if u talk to them outside office hours. If you join IIIT, you're going to have to work a lot. This can not be emphasized enough. On the day of counselling, our director tells prospective students to join only if they are ready to work very hard. From the day one students here work hard and enjoy the quality education here.

and.. if you just want to complete a B.Tech degree while sitting at home then a big Yes!
I was there for B.Tech ECE (2010-14) and my observations are:
* Clearing the exams in MRIU is cakewalk if you have little knowledge and good touch with faculties
* Lab/Practicals/Projects are all just for namesake
* Placements in MRIU depends on market and mostly they will push you to attend Off Campus in Chandigarh or Panipat on your own arrangements, and in those off campus you will see some 5K to 10K students from North India descending to get 100 or 200 jobs
Now even if you are lucky/talented enough to get a job in those off campus, you will be barred from attending Campus Placements
* Fee structure is way too high in NCR area and MRIU is no different, to add to fee you will have shed more and more on travel to the campus which is located quiet far from any bus/train/metro station
You will have to realize on local auto and they are gonna charge you 100+ to take you to nearest locality(Sec 21) even if you are bleeding from head.
* Few of the faculties are very good but majority of them are there because they are preparing for GATE or PO exam
Experienced faculty were i guess tired of internal politics among them and you will see even them unable to do any good for you
* Attendance: they will expect you to be at minimum 60% but i found even those with 30% just being warned for future
During placement session, they in fact used this as a reason to stop you from attending
*Other few things will be, they take fee for next semester from you before exams but they will not refund your security for years. [Its 2015 now, and even 2013 passed out are still waiting for their refund of 5k, now calculate the total money they have kept with them and the interest amount they woul have made on it]
* To summarize, if you are wealthy enough that you have no concerns of future and you have family business waiting for you, then go take it, you wont get many supplies or calls to home, but if you are even 10% serious for future then go to some other college.",2,

-Professors here care about your state of well being and are not absorbed in their research all day. They'll do anything they can to make sure you learn something valuable. I'm still in touch with some professors today!
-If you ignore the construction going on,  campus is beautiful. You'll see that when it's really nice outside, people'll sit near the trees, on benches, or basically anywhere they can outside to work. It certainly beats staying in a dorm room all day.
-Buildings, whether dorm rooms or academic facilities, are cleaned very thoroughly. 
-People here, for the most part, are VERY liberal.
-The few people I made friends with here are FANTASTIC. We're basically friends for life at this point.",3,
,,,,,,"2. biggest problem, in my opinion, is its lack of diversity, despite it claiming it to be one of the more diverse schools in New Jersey. Almost every person that I've met here (with the exception of a few) stays inside their social circle, and does not venture outside of it to meet different people. Athletes will stick together, fraternity brothers will stick together, computer geeks will stick together...basically, every high school clique you can think of exists here. Because I met people from all different groups, it was hard to fit in with just one of them. Diversity is not just about having students from varying backgrounds-it's also about having students interact with each other despite of this. ",3,

Some of the faculties are good in teaching having perfect knowledge and always being supportive. Even some are not good in teaching but are helpful. If there are pros then there are some cons in it. Here the cons are worst than ever.

Projects are given on monthly evaluation basis and the assignment is assigned on weekdays. Exams are well competitive and surprising most times which makes the habit of pre preparation.

The program that I am studying at the university is bachelors of technology in BIOTECHNOLOGY. Frankly speaking, the course would be primarily of interest for those who have studied biology in grade 11 and 12 since biotechnology is a lot about biology (as its name suggests :-p). For students who hate biology, i would suggest them to not opt for this branch. I loved biology and hence opted for this course. The coursework has been nicely divided into various segments and aims to cover almost every topic associated with biology in our 3 year long course. The first year is common to all students from different branches and each and everyone of us required to study maths, physics, electrical engineering etc. So for all those who hate mathematics and physics, i would suggest you to not to take admission in our college because your marks in first year is likely to spoil your GPA (I speak from experience. A lot of my classmates have failed in mathematics and physics in their first year). It would be better to study a Bachelor of sciences course from DELHI UNIVERSITY and maintain a fairly good GPA. Hence, the actual course starts from 2nd year and not your 1st year. Talking about the faculty, the teachers at our department are really nice. They tend to be strict while teaching but actually are a jovial bunch of people who are quite helpful. Also, the HOD of our department is really really nice. He is even more friendly than most of the teachers of our department. I would suggest that, maintain good terms with your teachers and lab assistants as they would be of great help while suggesting you about internships and while writing your recommendation letters. The faculty in our department is actually very well educated. Compared to teachers from other branches, the teachers in our department teach really well. Since there are very few takers of this course, the batch size is really small and that ensures that teacher is able to focus on every student. It might of disadvantage to some, who have joined this course only for the sake of getting a degree from Delhi technological university.",4,

So one gets more free period between 9AM to 5 PM to work in lab since the project in this semester holds a lot of credit and importance. During the 4th year, number of subjects each sem comes down to 3, 2 labs, major project 1 & 2, Seminar review. 

3rd and 4th sem students are supposed to prepare a review on research topic of their choice to be presented during the end of sem. While, 5th and 6th sem students are supposed to work on minor projects on a research topic of mutual interest of students and mentors. Mentors are assigned by the department and is subject to change by only the mutual agreement of everyone involved and availability of other option. final year students are supposed to do major project 1 & 2, one in each sem and this holds the most credit during these 2 semester. 

Assignments are subject wise and it's specification are totally on the wish of faculty. Students get assignment in team or solo. 

Each sem consists of one mid sem and one end sem examination which includes lab exams as well. All the exams are compulsory. 

Quality of teaching in department of polymer sciences and applied chemistry is nice. Teachers are really supportive in curriculum and they like to be involved in research.

From 2014, there are changes in exams which were two sessionals and semester exams before. Now 2014 session onwards there is a midterm exam followed by semester exam in the end.
Teachers are selected through UPSC exam, hence they are well educated.
Being a govt college, the attendance tension is almost nil. You can work on your projects taking help of the teachers who are ready to help anytime. You can play almost all games in the college. Sadly, there is no gym, but  you can stay fit by playing. Canteen is well maintained but not with so many options.
