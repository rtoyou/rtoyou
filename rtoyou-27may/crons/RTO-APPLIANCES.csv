1,Air conditioning,,"Air conditioning (often referred to as AC, A.C., or A/C) is the process of
 removing heat from a confined space, thus cooling the air, and 
removing humidity. This process is used to achieve a more 
comfortable interior environments, typically for humans or animals;
 however, air conditioners are also used to cool rooms filled with
 heat-producing electronic devices, such as computer servers or
 power amplifiers. Air conditioners often use a fan to distribute the
 conditioned air to an occupied space such as a building or a car to 
improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Electric refrigerant-
based AC units range from small units that can cool a small 
bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult to massive units 
installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building. 
The cooling is typically achieved through a refrigeration cycle, 
but sometimes evaporation or free cooling is used. Air 
conditioning systems can also be made based on desiccants. 
(chemicals which remove moisture from the air)[1]

In the most general sense, air conditioning can refer to any form of
 technology that modifies the condition of air (heating, cooling, (de-)
humidification, cleaning, ventilation, or air movement). In common
 usage, though, ""air conditioning"" refers to systems which cool air. 
In construction, a complete system of heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning is referred to as heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning (HVAC – as opposed to AC)","1. Air conditioning  removing heat from a confined space, thus cooling the air, and removing humidity",5,

2,Microwave oven,,"A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen
 appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave
 radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar 
molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a 
process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods
 quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer
 25–38 mm (1–1.5 inches) of a homogeneous, high water content
 food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in 
heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking
 techniques.
Percy Spencer is generally credited with inventing the modern 
microwave oven after World War II from radar technology developed
 during the war. Named the ""Radarange"", it was first sold in 1946. 
Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave 
oven that was first introduced by Tappan in 1955, but these units
 were still too large and expensive for general home use. The 
countertop microwave oven was first introduced in 1967 by the
 Amana Corporation, and their use has spread into commercial 
and residential kitchens around the world.
Microwave ovens are popular for reheating previously cooked foods
 and cooking a variety of foods. They are also useful for rapid 
heating of otherwise slowly prepared cooking items, such as hot
 butter, fats, and chocolate. Unlike conventional ovens, microwave
 ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, since they 
rarely attain the necessary temperatures to produce Maillard 
reactions. Exceptions occur in rare cases where the oven is
 used to heat frying-oil and other very oily items (such as bacon),
 which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water. 
Microwave ovens have a limited role in professional cooking
 because the boiling-range temperatures produced in
 especially hydrous foods impede flavors produced by the
 higher temperatures of frying, browning, or baking. However,
 additional heat sources can be added to microwave ovens, 
or into combination microwave ovens, to produce these 
other heating effects, and microwave heating may cut the overall 
time needed to prepare such dishes. Some modern microwave 
ovens are part of over-the-range units with built-in extractor hoods.",1. The capacity of a microwave oven defines the size of the oven and the amount of food that you can cook in it at one time.,5,

3,Appliance plug,,"An appliance plug is a three-conductor power connector originally 
developed for kettles, toasters and similar small appliances. It was
 common in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Germany,
 the Netherlands and Sweden.
It has largely been made obsolete and replaced by IEC 60320 C15
 and C16 connectors, or proprietary connectors to base plates for 
cordless kettles. It still occurs on some traditional ceramic electric 
jugs. It is also used for some laboratory water stills.
On some models of the classical ceramic electric jug, the appliance
 plug prevents the lid from being raised while the connector is inserted.
 This is important as during operation of these jugs, the water it 
contains is connected to the electric mains and is an electric shock risk.
Appliance plugs were also used to supply power to electric toasters, 
electric coffee percolators, electric frypans, and many other 
appliances. An appliance plug is to some degree heat resistant, but the 
maximum working temperature varied from manufacturer to 
manufacturer and even from batch to batch.
Appliance socket and plug
The mains connectors of the appliance plug are two rounded sockets 
that accept two rounded pins from the appliance. They are unpolarised. 
The third connection, earth, is a large metal contact on each side 
of the plug body which makes contact with the sides of the plug 
receptacle, grounding the appliance body. Some appliances using
 these connectors incorporate a spring and plunger mechanism with
 a temperature-sensitive release system; if the temperature rises 
significantly above a preset limit - for example, if a kettle boils dry - the
 spring is released and (if all goes well) the plunger pushes the plug 
and socket apart. It must then be allowed to cool and reset manually
 by forcing the connector back into the appliance.
A plug of same design but probably different dimensions was in use in 
former USSR for powering electric kettles and electric samovars.","1. I was hoping plugs would be better then let's say a Sears or a big box store when it came to delivery. They were not my refrigerator came in with a dented door. I thought for some reason they would check it before they brought it to me. They did not.  When I called to complain, I said I wasn't happy and I thought the woman that sold it to me could have been a little nicer on the phone.  The delivery fellows were great it's the store that wasn't.  By the way it was the store West Ashley.",1,
,,,,"2. Updating my prior review after Plugs owner worked to make things right. Seeing my yelp review he contacted me quickly to offer a loaner and then replacement option for the refrigerator I had originally ordered, which was not available in time for my holiday needs. He sent the replacement ""on trial"" and did not ask for payment until I was sure it would work for me. Clearly this business wants to make things right for the customer. I would try again if I have future appliance needs.",4,

4,Back boiler Stove,,"When you first look at a solid fuel plumbing diagram it can, if you are not a plumber, look a little daunting. This section of the Stove Fitter’s Manual is designed in such a way that, should you read it step by step, you will gradually build up a picture of a circuit a little at a time. Then, when you look at a plumbing diagram for “a typical system” you will understand it (hopefully). It is really not complicated. A wood burning or multifuel stove can, if it is fitted with a boiler, be used to heat a cylinder of water (for domestic hot water such as taps/bath/shower etc.) and/or one or more radiators.

A boiler is a metal box with water in it (it’s that simple) – it can be as simple as a cavity that is bolted within the stove.  This box will have two (or four) pipes that protrude through the rear of the stove ready to be attached to plumbing pipes. This style of boiler might be pre-fitted within the stove or sold as an add-on for the customer to fit themselves.

A stove might be designed with a “water jacket”. in this case the body of the stove has a cavity that can be filled with water (usually this cavity is in the rear and sides of the stoves and hence a common term for these boilers is a “wrap-around boiler”).","1. Bought the 5kw curve! Wow! Excellent service, excellent communication right through to the delivery! The stove itself is amazing! Highly recommended! & to stove world well done 5* & thank-you cannot recommend enough already spread the word!! Many thanks!",5,

I burn wood the vast majority of the time and I found that if I take the grate out it burns a thousand times better compared to burning wood on top of the grate, I was initially having problems getting the wood burning, I even opened the patio doors for maximum oxygen and opened vents fully and it still struggled. For the money I don't think this stove can be beaten.",4,
,,,,"3. It is with a heavy hart that I don't leave a 5 star review. The product is amazing, we have had the oven for 2 months now and have had amazing results for it. We cook all kind of things in the oven such as pizza, stakes and slow roasted Joints of meat. The only issue we have had is the temp gauge on the oven blackened the first time we used the oven. Stove world offered to replace the gauge but to date we have not received the replacement. So I will now replace the gauge at my own cost. (Thankfully you can get them cheaply on Amazon) Apart from the gauge issue I would recommend this oven. It's very well priced, well made and delivered quickly.",3,
,,,,"4. I bought this stove at the beginning of the winter and have used it almost every day since. My central heating has not been used since I fitted it and my 2 bed house is warmer than it ever was with heating. The stove retains it's heat over night so the house is still pleasantly warm in the morning, even after a cold winter night. The people at Stoveworld were very friendly and helpful, I went there with the intention of buying a different model (inset) the sound advice they gave ensured that I bought the correct model for my home. It cost around £300 for the stove, register plate and flue pipe. I spent a day installing it and due to a free supply of firewood have spent nothing else on heating my home this winter.",4,

5,Fan heater,,"A fan heater is a heater that works by using a fan to pass air over a 
heat source (e.g. a heating element). This heats up the air, which
 then leaves the heater, warming up the surrounding room. They can
 heat an enclosed space such as a room faster than a heater without 
fan, but, like any fan, create audible noise.Electric fan heaters can be
 less expensive to buy than other heaters due to simple construction. 
The fan carries heat away from the device, which can be made smaller 
without overheating. The relatively small amount of electricity used to 
operate the fan is partly converted to additional heat, so that efficiency 
is not a problem. All heaters without external ventilation are nearly 
100% efficient (minus a relatively small amount of energy used to
 operate the fan, indicator lights, etc.), meaning that almost all energy 
input goes into the room as heat. However, if the efficiency of 
generating the electricity is taken into account, the overall efficiency 
decreases significantly.
Electric fan heaters are more expensive to run than fuel powered
 heaters due to the cost of electricity. This makes them best suited
 to occasional use rather than as regularly used heat sources.
Externally vented non-electrical (combustion powered) fan heaters 
lose some heat to the outdoors, and are thus less efficient. These 
are used where it is necessary not to release the fumes of 
combustion into the heated area.","1. If you're looking for a cheap fan heater for occasional use to top up your rooms heat, or to warm up a small space. This basic model  has 74.7% of users giving it 3 to 5 stars and 46% of all users giving it the top 5 star rating (not bad for a £7.50 cheapie). It's  a robust little 2Kw heater with 2 heat settings, adjustable thermostat and a safety cut out to prevent overheating. Nicely styled, but can be a little louder than more expensive models. I have one in my tool shed and it doubles up as a nifty little fan in the summer. Originally bought as a stopgap thinking it was so cheap I would  throw it away, it has been in my tool shed for 5+ years now and I use it every winter. Not recommended for use as your main space heater or use for prolonged times.",3,
,,,,2. Dimplex are the worlds leading manufacturer of heating appliances and have been making heaters since 1973. All their heaters are BEAB approved and Dimplex heaters have stood the test of time.,3,
,,,,"3. Convection heaters are low maintenance so that you will not need to worry about the heater needing to be serviced regularly. They also don’t need to be refilled.
As most convection heaters don’t need a fan, they are very quiet and don’t produce an unpleasant noise. They are great for all rooms of the house including the bedroom because of this.",2,
,,,,"4. As convection heaters warm up on the outside as well as the inside, they become hot to touch. You should be wary if there are children or pets in your home and you may need to install a safety guard.
Convection heaters take a while to heat up so if it’s instant heat that you want, these space heaters are probably not for you.",2,

6,Clothes dryer,,"A clothes dryer, tumble dryer, drying machine or dryer is a powered
 household appliance that is used to remove moisture from a load 
of clothing and other textiles, usually shortly after they are washed in 
a washing machine. Clothes may also be dried by natural 
evaporation and, if available, sunlight on an outdoor or indoor 
clothes line or clothes horse.
Many dryers consist of a rotating drum called a ""tumbler"" through 
which heated air is circulated to evaporate the moisture, while the 
tumbler is rotated to maintain air space between the articles. Using
 these machines may cause clothes to shrink or become less soft 
(due to loss of short soft fibers/lint). A simpler non-rotating machine 
called a ""drying cabinet"" may be used for delicate fabrics and other
 items not suitable for a tumble dryer.","1. This dryer is a great for small spaces, but some may find the cycle times a bit long.",3,

7,Hair dryer,,"A hair dryer, hairdryer[1] or blow dryer is an electromechanical device 
designed to blow normal or hot air over damp hair, in order to 
accelerate the evaporation of water particles and dry the hair. Blow 
dryers allow better control over the shape and style of hair, by
 accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary hydrogen
 bonds inside each strand. These hydrogen bonds are very powerful 
(allowing for stronger hair shaping than even the sulfur bonds
 formed by permanent waving products), but are temporary and 
extremely vulnerable to humidity. They disappear with a single washing 
of the hair.
The normal use of a hair dryer
Hairstyles using blow dryers usually have volume and discipline, 
which can be further improved by the use of styling products and 
hairbrushes during drying to add tension, hold and lift.
Blow dryers were invented around the end of the 19th century. The 
first model was created by Alexander F. ""Beau"" Godefroy in his salon
 in France in 1890. The handheld, household hair dryer first appeared
 in 1920. Blow dryers are used both in beauty salons by professional
 stylists, and in the average household by consumers.",1. I love hair dryer. It gets my hair dry super fast and is the most quiet hair dryer I have ever used! Plus its extremely light weight and easy to handle.,4,
,,,,"2. I have fine thick curly hair and always blow dry it straight (usually every 3 days) and have been doing so for years now. I use to own a Parlux 2800 which I loved and would always get smooth straight hair with. Unfortunately after about 10 good years it died a couple of years ago and I could not find the same one so I purchased the Parlux 3200 Ceramic & Ionic Compact- I HATE this hairdryer as it is too powerful and no matter what setting I put it on I cannot achieve the same results I use to get with the 2800- my hair is more frizzy and I have lots of fly aways. I use to be able to run my brush through it a few times to get it straight and smooth but the 3200 dries it out too quickly creating frizz.

8,Hair iron,,"A hair iron or hair tong is a tool used to change the structure of the 
hair using heat. There are three general kinds: curling irons, used to
 make the hair curly, straightening irons, commonly called 
straighteners or flat irons, used to straighten the hair, and 
crimping irons, used to create crimps of the desired size in the hair.
Most models have electric heating; cordless curling irons or flat irons
 typically use butane, and some flat irons use batteries that can last 
up to 30 minutes for straightening. Overuse of these tools can cause
 severe damage to hair Curling irons, also known as curling tongs, 
create waves or curls in hair using a variety of different methods. 
There are many different types of modern curling irons, which can vary
 by diameter, material, and shape of barrel and the type of handle. The
 barrel's diameter can be anywhere from .5 in (1.3 cm) to 2 in (5.1 cm).
 Smaller barrels typically create spiral curls or ringlets, and larger 
barrels are used to give shape and volume to a hairstyle.
Curling irons are typically made of Teflon, ceramic, tourmaline, metal, or
 titanium, each of which has its pros and cons. The barrel's shape can
 either be a cylinder, cone, or reverse cone, and the iron can have brush
 attachments or double and triple barrels.
The curling iron can also have either a spring-loaded, Marcel, or clipless
 handle. Spring-loaded handles are the most popular and use a 
spring to work the barrel's clamp. When using a Marcel handle, one 
applies his or her own pressure to the clamp. Clipless wands have
 no clamp, and the user simply wraps hair around a rod. Most 
clipless curling irons come with a Kevlar glove to avoid burns.","1. Modern anti-static technology prevents frizz and fly-away hairs

9,Icebox,,"An icebox (also called a cold closet) is a compact non-mechanical
 refrigerator which was a common kitchen appliance before the 
development of safe powered refrigeration devices. Iceboxes had 
hollow walls that were lined with tin or zinc and packed with various 
insulating materials such as cork, sawdust, straw or seaweed. A 
large block of ice was held in a tray or compartment near the top of
 the box. Cold air circulated down and around storage compartments
 in the lower section. Some finer models had spigots for draining ice 
water from a catch pan or holding tank. In cheaper models a drip pan
 was placed under the box and had to be emptied at least daily. The
 user had to replenish the melted ice, normally by obtaining new ice
 from an iceman.
Commonly iceboxes were made of wood, most probably for ease of 
construction, insulation, and aesthetics; many were handsome
 pieces of furniture.","1.Icebox is the best with macaroons, ice cream, both combined, and more. Very good and even better than cream.
I love icebox and you should too.",3,

The milk shaved snow was pretty awful. I could taste how artificial the milk flavor was and the tapioca balls were too soft. I do not recommend getting shaved snow here. The cookies and ice cream were way better. I recommend the cookies and cream cookie. Snickerdoodle was also good. But, then again, nothing really stands out here. That's why this place gets an average rating from me. Next time I will have to try a macaron ice cream sandwich instead.",2,

10,Internet refrigerator,,"Internet refrigerator (also known as an smart refrigerator) is a 
refrigerator which has been programmed to sense what kinds of 
products are being stored inside it and keep a track of the stock
 through barcode or RFID scanning. This kind of refrigerator is often 
equipped to determine itself whenever a food item needs to be 
replenished. By the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the idea of
 connecting home appliances to the internet (Internet of Things) had 
been popularized and was seen as the next big thing. In June 2000, 
LG launched the world’s first internet refrigerator, the Internet Digital 
DIOS. This refrigerator was an unsuccessful product because the 
consumers had seen it as unnecessary and expensive (more than
 $20,000) and that the problems solved were obscure. For example, 
many juice bottles are transparent, providing a visual reminder that
 a purchase is needed eventually; vegetable drawers are similarly
 transparent and contain items often removed from packages, thus 
eliminating bar codes for inventory which meant manually keying in
 descriptions and dates. Moreover, the ability of the device to remind
 users of upcoming purchases when there are often multiple buyers
 in a household who communicate informally is not typically 
addressable as a use case","1. I had the misfortune to purchase six LG appliances. In the past two years, I have had 2 repairs to my refrigerator, 2 repairs to my stove, 1 repair to my washing machine, and my microwave had to be replaced. Presently, my products are still under a warranty, however, LG Repair service have refused to come to my house, again to fix my stove. DO NOT BUY LG PRODUCTS!",1,
,,,,"2. We purchased a $2,100 stainless steel French Door LG (Kenmore) model 795.71603.012 refrigerator from Sears just over five years ago. The unit lost its ability to keep the contents cold. Today the technician informed me that it would cost almost $1,000 to replace the compressor, condenser plus repair leaks. In addition, the technician detected a Freon leak at the point where the Freon enters the freezer and that leak cannot be repaired because it's buried in the chassis - the tech suggested it was time to buy another refrigerator.

This is the second time the compressor has failed in five years. My previous GE refrigerator lasted me 14 years when I sold it in working condition. LG refrigerators designs and parts are significantly flawed and need to be addressed. Too many complaints describe the same problem and other complaints describe a substandard product sold as a premium product. Considering the number of complaints, LG (Kenmore)'s attitude of ""too bad you're out of warranty"" should be confronted with ""too bad here's a class action lawsuit"" for selling a flawed, low quality, junk products.",1,
,,,,"3. We purchased a brand new LG refrigerator in July of 2015... At the time I did a fair amount of research and reviews on the brand and the model (French Door, Bottom Freezer), and all reviews were over 4/5 stars.

Fast-forward 13 months later (conveniently 1 month after the ""we cover everything"" part of their warranty ended), and the fan began to make a loud noise. A few days later, our fridge was no longer cooling, and on the digital panel we received a fan motor error code.

We had purchased a 5 year major appliance warranty from Lowe's... After 3 repairs in one weekend (each time the fridge went about 2 hours prior to it producing the same error code), followed by a separate service provider who had to order parts (and hasn't returned in over two weeks), we still do not have a working refrigerator. LG is a PoS company producing horrible quality appliances -- each service provider told us to never again buy an LG or Samsung appliance...

11,Manual vacuum cleaner,,"The manual vacuum cleaner was a type of non-electric vacuum 
cleaner, using suction to remove dirt from carpets, being powered 
by human muscle, similar in use to a manual lawn mower. Its 
invention is dated to the second half of the 19th century, when 
patents were granted to inventors in the United States, Britain, 
France, and elsewhere.These household appliances created 
suction by either a pumping action, bellows, a piston being pushed 
up and down a tube, or had a fan driven by the wheels. Most required
 the efforts of two people. The models operable by one person were
 less efficient, but none were truly labor-saving devices or delivered
 the cleaning efficiency they promised. Besides hand-operated 
models, foot-operated models were also available, and according to
 a Swiss source there was even one where the operator sat in a

12,Air ioniser,,"An air ioniser (or negative ion generator or ""Chizhevsky's chandelier"") 
is a device that uses high voltage to ionise (electrically charge) air 
molecules. Negative ions, or anions, are particles with one or more
 extra electrons, conferring a net negative charge to the particle. 
Cations are positive ions missing one or more electrons, resulting 
in a net positive charge. Most commercial air purifiers are designed
to generate negative ions. Another type of air ioniser is the electrostatic
 discharge (ESD) ioniser (balanced ion generator) used to neutralise
 static charge. In 2002, Cecil Alfred 'Coppy' Laws was credited with 
being the inventor of the domestic air ioniser in an obituary in The 
Independent newspaper.

13,Oil heater,,"An oil heater, also known as an oil-filled heater, oil-filled radiator, or 
column heater, is a common form of convection heater used in 
domestic heating. Although filled with oil, it is electrically heated and 
does not involve burning any oil fuel; the oil is used as a heat 
reservoir (buffer), not as a fuel. Oil heaters consist of metal columns
 with cavities, inside which silicone oil (mostly siloxanes like 
polydimethylsiloxane) flows freely around the heater. A heating
 element at the base of the heater heats up the oil, which then flows
 around the cavities of the heater by convection. The oil acts as a 
heat reservoir, with a relatively high specific heat capacity
(approximately 2 kJ.kg−1.K−1)[1] and high boiling point (approximately 
150–300 degrees Celsius).[2][3] The high specific heat capacity 
allows the oil to store a large amount of thermal energy in a small 
volume, while the high boiling point allows it to remain in the liquid
 phase for the purpose of heating, so that the heater does not have
 to be a high pressure vessel.
Using the oil as a heat reservoir, the heating element heats the oil, 
which remains warm for a long period of time while the heat is 
transferred to the metal wall through convection, through the walls via 
conduction, then to the surroundings via convection and radiation. 
The columns of oil heaters are typically constructed as thin fins, such 
that the surface area of the metal columns is large relative to the 
volume of the oil heat reservoir. A large surface area allows more air
 to be in contact with the heater at any point in time, allowing for the 
heat to be transferred more rapidly from the heater into the room.",1. An excellent heater for a small room.,3,

14,Oven,,"The earliest ovens were found in Central Europe, and dated to 29,000 
BC. They were roasting and boiling pits inside yurts used to cook 
mammoth.[2] In Ukraine from 20,000 BC they used pits with hot
 coals covered in ashes. The food was wrapped in leaves and set
 on top, then covered with earth.[3] In camps found in Mezhirich, 
each mammoth bone house had a hearth used for heating and 
cooking.[4] Ovens were used by cultures who lived in the Indus 
Valley and in pre-dynastic Egypt.[5][6] By 3200 BC, each mud-brick
 house had an oven in settlements across the Indus Valley. 
Ovens were used to cook food and to make bricks. Pre-dynastic
civilizations in Egypt used kilns around 5000–4000 BC to make pottery
 Culinary historians credit the Greeks for developing bread baking
 significantly.[8] Front-loaded bread ovens were developed in 
ancient Greece.[9] The Greeks created a wide variety of doughs
 loaf shapes, and styles of serving bread with other foods. Baking 
developed as a trade and profession as bread increasingly was
 prepared outside of the family home by specially trained workers
 to be sold to the public.[8]
During the Middle Ages, instead of earth and ceramic ovens,
 Europeans used fireplaces in conjunction with large cauldrons.
 These were similar to the Dutch oven. Following the Middle-
Ages, ovens underwent many changes over time from wood, iron,
 coal, gas, and even electric. Each design had its own motivation 
and purpose. The wood burning stoves saw improvement through
 the addition of fire chambers that allowed better containment and
 release of smoke. Another recognizable oven would be the cast-
iron stove. These were first used around the early 1700s when
 they themselves underwent several variations including the 
Stewart Oberlin iron stove that was smaller and had its own 
chimney.In the early part of the 19th century, coal ovens were 
developed. Its
 shape was cylindrical and was made of heavy cast-iron. The gas
 oven saw its first use as early as the beginning of the 19th century 
as well. Gas stoves became very common household ovens 
once gas lines were available to most houses and neighborhoods
. James Sharp patented one of the first gas stoves in 1826. Other 
various improvements to the gas stove included the AGA cooker
 invented in 1922 by Gustaf Dalén. The first electric ovens were
 invented in the very late 19th century, however, like many electrical
 inventions destined for commercial use, mass ownership of
 electrical ovens could not be a reality until better and more 
efficient use of electricity was available.
More recently, ovens have become slightly more high-tech in terms
 of cooking strategy. The microwave as a cooking tool was
 discovered by Percy Spencer in 1946, and with the help from 
engineers, the microwave oven was patented.[10] The microwave 
oven uses microwave radiation to excite the molecules in food 
causing friction, thus producing heat","1. Hey Guys, I have been using this item from past 06 months and I should say this the amount spent on this Oven is really worth and it's ideal for a family of four.",4,

15,Radiator (heating),,"Radiators and convectors are heat exchangers designed to transfer
 thermal energy from one medium to another for the purpose of 
space heating. The heating radiator was invented by Franz San 
Galli in 1855, a Prussian-born Russian businessman living in St.
 Petersburg.In practice, the term ""radiator"" refers to any of a number
 of devices in which a fluid circulates through exposed pipes (often
 with fins or other means of increasing surface area), notwithstanding
 that such devices tend to transfer heat mainly by convection and 
might logically be called convectors.
The term convection heater or convector refers to a class of devices
 in which the source of heat is not directly exposed. As domestic 
safety and the supply from water heaters keeps temperatures 
relatively low, radiation is inefficient in comparison to convection. 
Convection heaters also work differently to electric radiators in 
that they disperse heat differently. 
The international standard for energy efficient consumer products 
Energy Star recommends placing heat-resistant reflectors between
 radiators and exterior walls to help retain heat in a room.",1. Useful device,4,

16,Refrigerator,,"A refrigerator (colloquially fridge) is a popular household appliance
 that consists of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump
 (mechanical, electronic or chemical) that transfers heat from the
 inside of the fridge to its external environment so that the inside of 
the fridge is cooled to a temperature below the ambient temperature 
of the room. Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique in
 developed countries. The lower temperature lowers the 
reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of 
spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees
 above the freezing point of water. Optimum temperature range for 
perishable food storage is 3 to 5 °C (37 to 41 °F).[1] A similar device
 that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is 
called a freezer. The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had 
been a common household appliance for almost a century and a
 half. For this reason, a refrigerator is sometimes referred to as an
 icebox in American usage.
The first cooling systems for food involved using ice. Artificial
 refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 
1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration 
system was built. The first commercial ice-making machine was
 invented in 1854. In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented.
 In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The
 introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market
 during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments
 (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940
. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.
Freezer units are used in households and in industry and commerce. 
Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 
40 years prior to the common home models. Most households[citation
 needed] use the freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style,
 which has been the basic style since the 1940s. A vapor 
compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, 
refrigerator–freezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include 
automatic defrosting, chilled water and ice from a dispenser in the door.
Domestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a
 range of sizes. Among the smallest is a 4 L Peltier refrigerator 
advertised as being able to hold 6 cans of beer. A large domestic
 refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1 m wide
 with a capacity of 600 L. Refrigerators and freezers may be free-
standing, or built into a kitchen. The refrigerator allows the modern
 family to keep food fresh for longer than before. Freezers allow 
people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and bulk purchases  ave money.","1. The body of the fridge is as flimsy as most other refrigerators available these days. The light bulb is attached to the door of the freezer and the intensity of illumination is poor. This bulb does not light up the whole inside of the refrigerator. I found this to be a serious drawback, especially due to my poor vision.",3,

17,Tie press,,"A tie press is a device, based solely on pressure, to flatten neckties.
 Its use is necessitated by ties usually being of silk or some other 
textile ill-suited to the heat of ironing.
Tie presses usually operate based on two separate wooden boards
 which are clamped together with spring-loaded levers. A cardboard 
cut-out is usually included to retain the shape of the tie during pressing.
Tie presses are particularly useful for bow ties, due to the creasing
 and thus deformative nature of the bow tie knot, which involves 
crushing the ends to produce the 'bow' effect. In time, this crushing
 affects the appearance of the finished knot. This is particularly the 
case with bow ties with rectangular ends, rather than the 'bow' 
shaped ends in some bow ties, though both suffer from crushing to 
some degree or another. Four-in-hand ties, naturally, are also 
creased, but rarely to the same extent and, as such, usually require 
less regular pressing.","1. Comparable pay, good benefits, good hours, I hear chances of advancements (not this branch). It CAN be a good company (as a whole) to work for.",3,

18,Toaster and toaster ovens,,"A toaster, or a toast maker, is a small electric appliance designed to 
brown or ""singe""[1] sliced bread by exposing it to radiant heat, thus 
converting it into toast. Toasters can toast multiple types of sliced
 bread products. Invented in Scotland in 1893, it was developed over
 the years, with the introduction of an automatic mechanism to stop
 the toasting and pop the slices up – the ""pop up toaster"" in 1919 
being a significant development. The most common household 
toasting appliances in the 2010s are the pop-up toaster and the
 toaster oven. Bread slices are inserted into slots in the top of a 
pop-up toaster, which make toast from bread in one to three minutes
 by using electric heating elements. Toasters have a control to
 adjust how much the appliance toasts the bread. Since the 2000s, 
pop-up toasters with wider slots have been manufactured, 
enabling them to toast bagels cut in half or thick-sliced ""Texas
 toast"". Another trend of the 2000s is the increasing availability of 
four-slice toasters.

Toaster ovens have a hinged door in the front that opens to allow 
food to be placed on a rack, which has heat elements above and 
below the grilling area. Toaster ovens function the same as a 
small-scale conventional oven. Toaster ovens typically have settings
 to toast bread and a temperature control for use of the appliance 
as an oven. Most are large enough to heat up a slice of pizza or a
 burrito and some larger models can be used to bake a small 
casserole.",1. I ordered this product after reading a lot of reviews and wasn't expecting much. But for the price this was a very pleasant surprise.

19,Washing machine,,"A washing machine (laundry machine, clothes washer, or washer) is 
a machine used to wash laundry, such as clothing and sheets. The
 term is mostly applied to machines that use water as opposed to
 dry cleaning (which uses alternative cleaning fluids, and is performed 
by specialist businesses) or ultrasonic cleaners.Clothes washer
 technology developed as a way to reduce the manual labor spent, 
providing an open basin or sealed container with paddles or fingers
 to automatically agitate the clothing. The earliest machines were 
hand-operated and constructed from wood, while later machines
 made of metal permitted a fire to burn below the washtub, keeping
 the water warm throughout the day's washing.
The earliest special-purpose mechanical washing device was 
the washboard, invented in 1797 by Nathaniel Briggs of New
 Hampshire.
By the mid-1850s steam-driven commercial laundry machinery 
were on sale in the UK and US.[4] Technological advances in 
machinery for commercial and institutional washers proceeded 
faster than domestic washer design for several decades, 
especially in the UK. In the United States there was more 
emphasis 
on developing machines for washing at home, though machines 
for commercial laundry services were widely used in the late 
19th and early 20th centuries The rotary washing machine was
 patented by Hamilton Smith in 1858. As electricity was not 
commonly available until at least 1930, some early washing 
machines were operated by a low-speed, single-cylinder hit-and
-miss gasoline engine.

electronics small appliance used for boiling waterand 
maintaining it at a constant temperature. It is typically used to provide 
an immediate source of hot water for making tea,[1] hot chocolate, 
coffee,instant noodles, or baby formula, or for any other household
 use where clean hot water is required. They are a common 
component of Japanese kitchens and the kitchens of many East
 Asian countries but are found in varying use globally. Some thermo
 pots are designed with a feature that can purify waterAn electric 
water boiler consists of a water reservoir with a heating element 
at the bottom. Some models offer multiple temperature settings. 
Other models are part of larger water systems that boil water and 
provide hot, cold, and lukewarm water. Water may be dispensed 
in various ways, e.g. by pouring, an electric pump or by pressing
 a large button that functions as a diaphragm pump. Electric water
 boilers have a built in thermostat that detects when water has

 window. Window fans have been used for many decades to maintain
 comfortable temperatures and ventilation within one's home, and 
operate at a tiny fraction of the cost of central air conditioning.
Window fans are designed to fit into open windows, and often have 
expandable side panels to cover the entire window opening.
 Most units have either one large fan, or two small fans mounted 
side by side.
Most window fans have two or three speeds, and some are 
electrically reversible so that the user can switch between intake
 and exhaust modes.
Manufacturers have added features to their models over the years.
 Some fans contain thermostats which will turn the fan off if the
 temperature drops to a certain point, or adjustable grilles to 
direct the flow of air in a particular direction. Other fans offer
 sophisticated electronic features such as a remote control, 
automatic shut-off timers, and dimmer-like variable-speed motor
 controls.

22,Television,,"Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting
 moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in
 two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set,
 a television program (""TV show""), or the medium of television
 transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment,
 education, news, and advertising.
Television became available in crude experimental forms in the
 late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War
 II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became
 popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became 
commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the
 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public
 opinion.[1] In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced
 in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of
 storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs
 (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers
 to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the
 end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions
 greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move
 from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced
 lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), 
which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be
 transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, 
with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased 
the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through 
streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.
In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television setThe 
replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen
displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies
 such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), 
and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer
monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-
panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation 
of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-
2010s.[3][4][5] LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in
 the near future. Also
, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce
 smart TV sets in the mid-2010s.[7][8][9] Smart TVs with integrated Internet

 regulates the heat level of a building's attic by exhausting hot air. A
 thermostat is used to automatically turn the fan off and on, while 
sometimes a manual switch is used. An attic fan can be gable 
mounted or roof mounted. Additional vents are required to draw in 
fresh air as the hot air is exhausted. Attic fans are typically used in 
warmer months, when temperatures in an attic can exceed 120 °F
 (49 °C). A fan may be installed in an attic for the different purpose of
cooling a while house, venting hot air out via the attic; such fans are
 often called whole-house fans. ",1. doesn't move the amount of air advertised. even on bright midday sun. had to hook up to a battery system to get full use . now we'll see how long it lasts. won't buy a second one. will look elsewere,3,

And if your attic is cooler, your house will stay cooler. The problem is that most 120-volt attic exhaust fans are really noisy. The noise from gable-mounted fans isn't too obnoxious, but the noise from roof-mounted fans can drive you up the wall.

26,Flame supervision device,,"For gas appliances, a flame supervision device (FSD) – alternative 
name: flame failure device (FFD) – is a general term for any device
 designed to stop flammable gas going to the burner of a gas appliance
 if the flame is extinguished. This is to prevent a dangerous buildup of
 gas within the appliance, its chimney or the room.[1] Causes of flame
 failure include chimney downdraught, temporary interruption of the gas 
supply, gas under-pressure, liquid overspill on cooker hotplates or the
 draught from an oven door being opened and closed.
FSDs may utilize one of several technologies: thermoelectric valves,
 flame conductance, flame rectification, ultraviolet sensing devices 
and liquid expansion valves.[1] FSDs are found on all modern gas
 appliances.[citation needed]
Cooker hotplates may not have a FSD on each burner. If a hotplate is
 to be used in a multi-occupancy building every burner must have its
 own FSD.
When the FSD activates it should stop (or reduce to safe levels) gas
 flow to the burner until it is reset manually.
Older devices, such as bimetallic strips, were used in conjunction 
with pilot lights. The pilot light is no longer used in new devices, but may
 still be encountered on old appliances still in service.[1] Pilot lights were
 withdrawn for two reasons: their continual small flame represented a
 waste of fuel and also the FSD protected only the main burner, not the 
pilot. If the pilot was extinguished, there was still the risk of a small gas
 leakage.
Regular testing of FSD is a part of routine maintenance for gas appliances.
Other safety devices may be fitted in addition to an FSD. One type of these
 are the Vititation Sensing Devices,[3] that detect an adequate supply of 
oxygen for efficient combustion, thus avoiding the production of poisonous 
carbon monoxide. As well as detecting a blocked supply of oxygen, these
 must also detect a blocked exhaust or reversed flow in the exhaust flue
 owing to wind conditions. Two methods are used to provide these, an 
Oxygen Depletion System (ODS) that measures the availability of oxygen 
for combustion or an Atmospheric Sensing Device (ASD) measures 
excess heat rise in the exhaust.",1.I needed 2 items for my broken Cannon Cooker. eSpares helped me identify the parts needed. I ordered them and they arrived within a couple of days. Both have been installed and the cooker is working. Great sevice and genuine parts.,3,

 ceremonies and even as weapons of war. Fire pots were vital to the 
development of civilization. Once humans had learned to contain, 
control and sustain fires, they had an invaluable tool for cooking
 food that would have otherwise not been edible. Fire pots were
 also useful for sharpening spears, hollowing out canoes, baking
 pottery, and many other tasks, such as staying warm.
At first, humans relied on natural fires, caused by lightning strikes 
or other natural occurrences, to provide them with a flame to start
 their own fires. Since natural fires are not very common, humans
 learned how to make fires by igniting tinder from sparks caused
 by striking stones together, or by creating friction using a bow drill.
Given the time-consuming nature of early firestarting, humans 
eventually began to use earthenware vessels, or fire pots, in 
which slow-burning fires could by kept alight indefinitely by using
 small quantities of fuel. Nomadic people could carry these small
 fires with them, using them to start larger fires for their evening
 camps.
Archaeologists found that fire pots were being used 10,000, or 
more, years ago, according to finds during the 1936-37 dig in 
Fells Cave ,[1] of which is located in the valley of the Rio Chico, 
not far from the Strait of Magellan.
Semi-nomadic and sedentary people would have made or 
acquired more advanced types of fire pots, as opposed to the fully 
nomadic people who would have used more primitive types. Being
 more sedentary, people were able to more effectively work with clay,
 and would have kilns to bake the pottery in, instead of using the 
traditional fire-baking methods.",,,

31,Food steamer,,"A food steamer or steam cooker is a small kitchen appliance used to 
cook or prepare various foods with steam heat by means of holding
 the food in a sealed vessel that limits the escape of air or liquids 
below a preset pressure. This manner of cooking is called steaming. 
Food steamers have been used for centuries. The ancient Chinese
 used pottery steamers to cook food. Archaeological excavations
 have uncovered pottery cooking vessels known as yan steamers; 
a yan composed of two vessel, a zeng with perforated floor 
surmounted on a pot or caldron with a tripod base and a top cover. 
The earliest yan steamer dating from about 5000 BC was unearthed
 in the Banpo site.[1] In the lower Yangzi River, zeng pots first 
appeared in the Hemudu culture (5000–4500 BC) and Liangzhu 
culture (3200–2000 BC) and used to steam rice; there are also yan
 steamers unearthed in several Liangzhu sites, including 3 found
 at the Chuodun and Luodun sites in southern Jiangsu.[2] In the 
Longshan culture (3000–2000 BC) site at Tianwang in western 
Shandong, 3 large yan steamers were discovered","1. Steam healthy vegetables for authentic Asian stir fry dinners for your family, with the All Clad Stainless Steel Steamer",2,

appliance that features one, two or more electric heating elements 
or gas burners. A hot plate can be used as a stand alone appliance
, but is often used as a substitute for one of the burners from an 
oven range or a kitchen stove. Hot plates are often used for food 
preparation, generally in locations where a full kitchen stove would
 not be convenient or practical. A hot plate can have a flat surface,
 or round surface. Hot plates can be used for traveling, when you 
have no power, or out in the woods.","1. Looking for a new double burner to replace your old one? Or perhaps, having a kitchen remodel",2,

33,Mess kit,,"A mess kit is a collection of silverware and cookware used during 
camping and backpacking, as well as extended military campaigns. 
There are many varieties of mess kits available to consumers, and
 militaries commonly provide and have historically provided them to
 their troops.While functionally similar to a one-man civilian mess kit,
 military mess kits are designed to be even more compact, using
 their space as efficiently as possible. Thus lids will almost always
 be used for preparing, cooking, and/or eating, and usually come in
 two or three pieces. As such, it may sacrifice certain features, or use 
other features to complement it.
When in a large camp, it is common for soldiers to use either normal 
dining wares, or a multi-compartment mess tray similar to a TV 
Dinner tray, but much larger.","1.My wife and I used this along with some older cookware on our three day camping trip. I did a little research online and read the differences between stainless steel products and aluminum. Aluminum ones are a lot cheaper but are not as forgiving when cooking over a campfire. You definitely want a stainless steel mess kit!
The mess kit came in a small blue polyester bag with a drawstring. It isn't a very big mess kit but its good enough when cooking for two. When the pan is hot you don't have to worry about the handle burning you because of the way it's designed.
After cooking breakfast I went off to clean the cookware. My aluminum set had to be scrubbed hard even after soaking but this stainless steel mess kit took almost no effort at all. It was very great!
When it comes time to put it away you will find that it all nests very neatly inside itself. The pot and lid sit inside the pan and the bowl sits upside down on top of the pan to make a lid. The handle then folds over to lock it all in place. It is a very nice compact set.
I recommend this to anyone looking for a small compact mess kit for one or two people.
",4,
,,,,"2. this set is plenty lightweight for the backpacker on a budget. ALWAYS buy stainless steel instead of aluminum for cooking on/in. The only two gripes I have about this set are: 1) the frying pan's lid/plate isn't useful as a lid because it lacks a handle of any kind, so it couldn't be removed if hot 2) the ""locking handle"" on the frying pan only locks the whole set closed, but it does NOT lock into the open/extended position as pictured, so, while pouring/tilting the pan, the handle could fold up and result in an irritating or painful accident. In practice, however, this can be avoided if you don't tilt it too close to vertical.",4,

35,Sandwich toaster,,"A pie iron, pudgy pie iron, sandwich toaster or jaffle iron, is a cooking
 appliance that consists of two hinged concave, round or square, 
metal plates on long handles. The appliance is used to heat, toast 
and seal a sandwich of two slices of bread and a filling.Modern 
versions of the pie-iron are commonly more domestic, if not 
necessarily more refined, with subdivisions allowing pairs of bread
 slices to be clamped together around fillings to form pockets or
 stuffed sandwiches. A combination of heat and pressure seals
 the bread at the outer edges.
Campfire versions are still made of cast iron and can be cooked
 over coals, open flames, or over a stove but lightweight aluminium
 stove-top versions are made, generally being coated with a non-
stick surface both as a cleaning aid and to allay fears regarding
 aluminium in the diet.
Rights acquired by John O'Brien for Australian cookware company
Breville in the 1970s[2] mean the name Breville is sometimes used
 eponymously to describe both the device and a toasted, sealed
 sandwich.[3] Regardless of brand counter-top sandwich toasters 
are notorious for being little-used. A British survey in 2005 suggested 
that 45% of British adults own but do not use sandwich toasters.","1. This is a neat little sandwich maker. It's a lot smaller than the picture makes it out to be.

36,Self-cleaning oven,,"A self-cleaning oven is an oven which uses high temperature
 (approximately 500 degrees Celsius or 900 degrees Fahrenheit) to 
burn off leftovers from baking, without the use of any chemical agents.
Self-cleaning ovens have a pyrolytic ground coat,[1] which reduces 
foodstuffs to ash with exposure to temperature around 500 °C (932 °F). 
The oven walls are coated with heat- and acid-resistant porcelain enamel.
A self-cleaning oven is designed to stay locked until the high
 temperature process is completed. A mechanical interlock is used to
 keep the oven door locked and closed during and immediately after
 the high-temperature cleaning cycle, which lasts approximately three
 hours, to prevent possible burn injuries. Usually, the door can be
 opened after the temperature cools to approximately 300 °C (572 °F)
Self-cleaning ovens usually have more insulation than standard 
ovens to reduce the possibility of fire. The insulation also reduces the
 amount of energy needed for normal cooking.[citation needed]
Self-cleaning ovens are considered more convenient and time saving
 therefore more cost effective. However, because of the high 
temperatures of burning, they produce smoke and odors. In some 
cases, this may set off a fire alarm. According to most professionals,
 this can be avoided by regular usage of the self-cleaning program","1.We bought an oven built in from IKEA - Whirlpool. It didn't work from the beginning. We called for a technician, who comes in the next day, took the defective part and ordered a new one. Took two weeks to arrive. Now I just found out that I will have to wait another week for somebody to come and install the replaced part. I am very disappointed with their way to serve me as a client",2,

I used the product given to me by Sears and tried several others but still could not take marks off of the glass top. I never really used the oven that much until retired and started baking often.,1,
,,,,3.When we moved into our home this past year there was a Whirlpool gas stove model number W10406473A. We have the plastic knobs on the front of the stove which need to be pushed and turned in order to turn on the gas. I recently ran into a serious problem where my cat walked across the knob area and pushed and turned the knob causing the gas to come on the stove. This is a problem due to the fact that a child could have also have easily turned on this stove. This is a definite fire hazard as well as a carbon dioxide problem. I warn anyone with this stove to replace it with another make or model immediately. I'm in the beginning mode of looking to see if a recall has ever been made on this model.,1,

37,Stove,,"A stove is an enclosed space in which fuel is burned to provide 
heating, either to heat the space in which the stove is situated, or to 
heat the stove itself and items placed on it. This article is principally 
concerned with enclosed stoves burning solid fuels for room heating. 
A kitchen stove is used to cook food. A wood-burning stove or a coal
 stove is typically used for heating a dwelling. Enclosed stoves are 
more efficient and prevents air from being sucked from the room into
 the chimney.
Due to concerns about air pollution, efforts have been made to
 improve stove design.[1] Pellet stoves, for example are a type of 
clean-burning stove. Air-tight stoves more completely combust wood
 and eliminate polluting combustion products. In the U.S. since 1992,

38,Tandoor,,"The term tandoor /tɑːnˈdʊər/ refers to a variety of ovens, the most 
commonly known is a cylindrical clay or metal oven used in cooking 
and baking. The tandoor is used for cooking in Southern, Central 
and Western Asia,[1] as well as in the Caucasus.[2]
The heat for a tandoor was traditionally generated by a charcoal or 
wood fire, burning within the tandoor itself, thus exposing the food to
 live-fire, radiant heat cooking, and hot-air, convection cooking, and 
smoking by the fat and food juices that drip on to the charcoal.
Temperatures in a tandoor can approach 480 °C (900 °F), and it is 
common for tandoor ovens to remain lit for long periods to maintain
 the high cooking temperature. The tandoor design is something of a
 transitional form between a makeshift earth oven and the horizontal
-plan masonry oven.","1.This product is awesome and amazon is the ONLY vendor who offers the tikka masala without the side of rice. I love the fact that tandoor chef isn't afraid to use the real Indian spices and gives this dish the proper spicy ""kick"" it deserves. Even if you aren't a fan of frozen food, give this one a try.

,,,,"3.I will start by saying I did not by this on Amazon so I cannot speak to this seller.

I can say that the product as a whole is very good. I buy the chicken with rice from my local grocery store and have been very impressed with it. It is remarkably better than competing brands.

I would prefer if the serving was larger, but am not certain I'd buy the box of only chicken without rice. The reason for that being that I want to throw something in the microwave and make a meal. I don't want to have to make my own rice or other side. That being said, it's not like the chicken and rice is a small serving.

Perhaps that just speaks to how much I like the product. My only ""complaint"" is that I want more of it per box.

So I bought the 12 pack without rice from amazon. Arrived very quickly, in a cooler with dry ice, and still frozen. Yes, I do have to make my own rice with it, but that turns a 5 minute dinner into a 15 minute dinner. Really not that bad. On top of that, it makes SO much food. A box of this with rice could easily feed two people.",5,

I LOVE Tandoor Chef's pizzas and naan, and the reviews here are usually great at pointing me in the right direction - but this order was the complete opposite of everything I expected. I prepared a box as soon as my order arrived, and couldn't help but feel sick upon the realization that I'd paid almost $60 for what amounted to a tiny scattering of gross tasting/textured gristle in sauce. I don't like to waste food, but I actually had to spit out pieces of meat because I couldn't chew through them.

39,Wet grinder,,"A wet grinder can refer to either a tool for abrasive cutting of hard 
materials, or a food preparation appliance used especially in Indian
 cuisine for grinding food grains to produce a paste or batter. A wet 
grinder for abrasive cutting uses fluid for lubrication or cooling, whereas
 one for food preparation uses water to combine with ground grain
 to produce batter.Wet grinding is rare in western cuisine but common 
n Indian cuisine. Wet grinders are used to make pastes from grains
 and lentils, such as those used in cooking dosas and idlis in South
 Indian cuisine.[1] These grinders generally consists of a few granite
 stone plates that are rolled against another stone plate with the
 items to be ground between them. Wet grinders have two advantages 
over electric mixers or blenders. First, the stone grinder generates
 less heat than a mixer; heat affects the flavor of the food. Second,
 the stones remain sharp for a greater time than do metal blades.
Dosa is made from a batter obtained by wet-grinding rice and pulses
Wet grinders are largely manufactured in Coimbatore because 
granite is easily available in this region.[1] Beginning in March 2006

40,Mixer,,"A mixer is a kitchen utensil which uses a gear-driven mechanism to 
rotate a set of beaters in a bowl containing the food to be prepared. It 
automates the repetitive tasks of stirring, whisking or beating. When
 the beaters are replaced by a dough hook, a mixer may also be used
 to knead.

A mixer may be a handheld mechanism known as an eggbeater, a
 handheld motorized beater, or a stand mixer. Stand mixers vary in 
size from small counter top models for home use to large capacity
 commercial machines. Stand mixers create the mixing action by 
rotating the mixing device vertically: planetary mixers, or by rotating 
the mixing container: spiral mixers.
Mixers for the kitchen first came into use midway through the
 nineteenth century; the earliest were mechanical devices. The 
demand from commercial bakers for large-scale uniform mixing 
resulted in the development of the electric stand mixer. Smaller 
counter-top stand mixers for home kitchen use soon followed.
When selecting a mixer, the purchaser should consider how the 
mixer will be used. Electric mixers with more speed options give
the user more control over the development of the mixture.","1 It went back right away and I got my mother in law the full sized...

,,,,"2.Several years ago I bought this--the copolyester, BPA-free version--as a travel espresso maker. Despite the name and claims, it does not make real espresso. Period. Bit that is not the reason for this review.

I have since started drinking coffee in the winter, and I enjoy using this to make ""filtered French press"" coffee. The resulting coffee is milder and mellowed, but I have enjoyed using lighter roasted, brighter coffee beans.

So why my poor rating? The other day I took a closer look at the coffee-stained brewing chamber and realized that it was as rough as 30-grit sandpaper. Under a magnifying glass, I could see large crevices in the plastic brewing chamber. The plastic has been slowly disintegrating. Into my coffee.

So what is this ""copolyster"" that I have been drinking in my coffee? A quick online education reveals that ""by introducing diacids or other diols to the polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the material becomes a copolyester."" The manufacturer of the AeroPress doesn't say much about the material other than claiming it won't leach phthalates. But polyesters ARE phthalates. Further, a literature review in 2009 published in Environmental Health Perspectives by Leonard Sax (""Polyethylene Terephthalate May Yield Endocrine Disruptors"") revealed massive leaching of phthalates from PETs in hot environments (above 70 degrees C), particularly with acidic substances. Well, my coffee is well above 70C, and everyone's coffee is acidic. So I am left to conclude that I have likely been mega-dosing myself with endocrine-disrupting phthalates every morning for the past couple years! Do yourself a favor and brew in glass, stainless steel, porcelain, or similar material known to be inert at high temperatures!",1,

It's dark brown and impossible to see the level of grounds or water you've added. Following instructions that say to ""fill to #3"" etc, just can't be followed. The coffee was ok, but I'm sure using accurate measurements is key, and that was impossible with the unit I received. Many of the product photos show a MUCH lighter smoked color if not totally clear units. Mine was nothing like those, so be warned.",2,

It's not exactly speedy. I usually make 1 cup a day with it, my ""good"" cup, and then have some regular coffee later on. For a while you will be playing around with it, fine-tuning your process until you find one that works. It took about 20 cups for me to find my pattern. I heat water in a glass in the microwave for 1:50, run it through 3 tbsps. of fresh grounds in the aeropress, then heat up the finished cup for another 30 seconds. (Making the water hotter to begin with doesn't work as well - took me a while to discover that.)

I wouldn't say I'm a coffee snob, and I'm not even buying fresh locally roasted beans. Just whatever looks nice and is on sale from Kroger. I enjoy a nice cup of coffee, and this provides it. After a year I am about halfway through the filters that came with it. It's a great little coffee maker and worth the price.",5,

 or chemical means into food, or of food into other forms. Food
 processing combines raw food ingredients to produce marketable
 food products that can be easily prepared and served by the

mincing and macerating, liquefaction, emulsification, and cooking
 (such as boiling, broiling, frying, or grilling); pickling, pasteurization,
 and many other kinds of preservation; and canning or other 
packaging. (Primary-processing such as dicing or slicing, freezing 
or drying when leading to secondary products are also included.)","1.The Cuisinart food processor is a wonderful tool -- I use it nearly every day, and it slices, chops, purees, and makes pizza dough to perfection. My only complaint is that in an effort to make the machine super-safe they've made it more awkward to use. An old model I had had a feed tube with a ""pusher"" that could be removed, making it quick and easy to add more vegetables, crackers, etc. The new model has the ""pusher"" permanently fixed to the feed tube, making it necessary to remove the entire cover in order to add more food. Does the company really think we're so careless that we can't be trusted with the removable pusher? The new version is slower and more awkward to use, and I wish they'd go back to the old system. Nonetheless, it's a wonderful, reliable machine and I'm happy to recommend it.",4,

I am thrilled and what a time saver, it takes the time consuming chopping by hand and does it in seconds, freeing me up to do the gourmet preparations that I'm beginning to discover that I truly love doing. A few days ago I roasted a large piece of deer meat and needed to chop it for chilli, so quick and easy. Your Cuisinart will save you hours and we need those extra hours to the things we love doing in our fast paced world.

The last one, which my current purchase replaces, suffered from the latter two fatal injuries--I had owned it about five years. I am a serious cook but I don't consciously abuse my appliances. Cuisinarts simply do not last all that long under constant use, as I am sure many other cooks will testify. However, I haven't found a better replacement brand (and yes, I own a Kitchenaid Mixer, and a Cuisinart blender and I owned an Osterizer food processer once and it was a disaster). The 14-cup Cuisinart represents a step up for me, as my prior machines were 11 cup models or smaller. I decided to go with the larger workbowl, as I often have dealt with the volcanic eruption or silent seepage of liquids through the spindle hole when the 11-cup model is too full. So far the 14-cup is fine, but the real test comes about three years from now, when the warranty has expired and the mortal coil starts to shuffle off. Stay tuned. I would note that the dealer who sent this to me--the dealer with the lowest price on the day I purchased the Cuisinart (and an Amazon sub-contractor)--sent me a scratched model. Kind of disgusting, but not worth the bother of shipping back and forth for a replacement.",4,

43,Induction cooking,,"Induction cooking heats a cooking vessel by magnetic induction, 
instead of by thermal conduction from a flame, or an electrical heating
 element. Because inductive heating directly heats the vessel, very
 rapid increases in temperature can be achieved.
In an induction cooker, a coil of copper wire is placed under the 
cooking pot and an alternating electric current is passed through
 it. The resulting oscillating magnetic field induces a magnetic
 flux which repeatedly magnetises the pot, treating it like the lossy
 magnetic core of a transformer. This produces large eddy currents
 in the pot, which because of the resistance of the pot, heats it.
For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel 
must be made of, or contain, a ferromagnetic metal such as
 cast iron or some stainless steels. However, copper, glass, 
non magnetic stainless steels, and aluminum vessels can be 
used if placed on a ferromagnetic disk which functions as a 
conventional hotplate.
Induction cooking is quite efficient, which means it puts less waste
 heat into the kitchen, can be quickly turned off, and has safety 
advantages compared to gas hobs (cooktops). Hobs are also
 usually easy to clean, because the hob itself does not get very hot.","1. Our review from December published below originally gave this PIC a five star review. I have changed to only ONE star now. SO, if you happen to read any comments by other folks which might not make sence, that is why...",2,

,,,,3. i order this iteam and liked it.. however it is VERY FRAGILE... I droped a empty plastic cup on it from a hight of 6 inch and the cook top shattered. it happed after the return date so i might be s.o.l. it sadens me i liked the iteam alot before it broke.,1,
,,,,"4. When you want to brown a piece of meat or even just frying, place a thin cloth on top of the cook top letting the cloth spread out over the cook top. Then put your pot on top of the cloth.It will catch all of the pops of grease and keep everything nice and grease free. It's hard for people to do this at first because we always think that it will catch fire. But it hardly gets warm. Try it.",5,

44,electric kettle,,"A kettle, sometimes called a tea kettle or teakettle, or a water hotter is 
a type of pot, usually metal, specialized for boiling water, with a lid,
 sprouts and handle, or a small bathroom appliance of similar shape
 that functions in a self-pertained manner. Kettles can be heated
 either by placing on a wire brush, or by their own internal electric 
heating element in the appliance versions.","1 I returned this kettle and bought Hampton Beach's instead. Two key features no one had mentioned that were dealbreakers:
1. It took 12 minutes to boil the full pot from tepid tap water. My stove top tea kettle takes the same amount of time.
2. You can't see the water level from the outside.",1,
,,,,"2. I bought this electric kettle after my stove top kettle needed replacement. It is great -- it boils water very quickly and turns itself off automatically which is a great safety feature. I did a lot of research before I purchased this model, I highly recommend this one -- it gets good reviews and there is no plastic inside the kettle -- many of the others have plastic viewers that are immersed in the hot water, I did not want my hot water in contact with plastic. I haven't found any negative aspects to this kettle and have been using it daily for over three months.",5,
,,,,"3. I have always used a stove top kettle, so I was leery to try out an electric kettle. When I received the product it was easy to get going. The first time I filled the entire kettle with cold water and boiled it through. It boiled very quickly and the automatic shut off worked great!

One of the reasons I tried an electric kettle is because I could never find a stove top kettle that poured smooth and didn't run all over the counter. This product pours smoother than anything I have found and doesn't agitate the tea bag.

Over all this is a great product and I would recommend this to anyone.",4,

45,juicer,,"A juicer (also known as juicing machine or juice extractor) is a tool
 used to extract juice from fruits, herbs, leafy greens and other types 
of vegetables in a process called juicing. It crushes, grinds, and/or
 squeezes the juice out of the pulp.

Some types of juicers can also function as a food processor. Most 
of the twin gear and horizontal masticating juicers have attachments
 for crushing herbs and spices, extruding pasta, noodles or bread 
sticks, making baby food and nut butter, grinding coffee, making nut milk, etc.","1. This juicer works very well. It quickly processed all the fruits and vegetables I have tried so far. I tried tasting the pulp produced by the juicer and it was pretty tasteless, no juice left in it at all. I had no problems with the juicer jamming or having any other issues.",5,
,,,,"2.  This machine is probably a one-off made by Huron for Mondial (a South American brand of appliance) which has little to no presence in North America. The sellers seem to be liquidating stocks of this juicer, which was intended to be sold in Brazil, and which explains why some of the machines arrive with foreign instructions. As of this writing, it looks as if this machine is no longer offered.",4,
,,,,"3. This is one amazing juicer! I did a lot of research and new it was the one for me, today it arrived and I really put it to work, apples, carrots, pears, watermelon cannolope grapes, celery, kiwi, cucumbers, kale, beats even ginger root, no trouble great output amazing taste, dry pulp.
I am one more than satisfied customer, other comparable juicers were in a whole other price bracket, but this one was in the range and preforms like the high end models.",5,
,,,,4. I love it! Best juicer for me. It gets a lot of use and I am happy with all the many juices I've made so far. Just a little hard to clean the wire basket at times and my brush has started falling apart. Also I have to double strain to get a compleatly pulp free product. But pulp doesn't really bother me. Over all I love my juicer!,4,

46,shaver,,"Shaver means a person who shaves, or an object which shaves, a 
razor. It may also refer to:

    A breed of chicken (Red Shaver) that is multipurpose, good for laying

","1. This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. Until this remarkable shaver, which I was steered to by other reviewers here in Amazon, I have not been able to get a decent shave with any razor, blade or electric. I am not young, and shaving under my chin--where the wrinkles are emphasized--has been a problem for years. But this relatively inexpensive Braun does it incredibly well, better than the $100 Remington I've had to throw away, and better even than the 3-bladed Gillettes--with motors or not--although they were the best before the Braun. I hope many will buy this great instrument so it will never be taken off the market. I want it to be there if ever I need a new razor again.",5,
,,,,"2. This price - quality is outstanding. this is a well made shaver for the money. Works plugged in when the battery is drained. This is a big feature. Lets say the battery runs out in the middle of your shave. now what do you do? go out half shaved? Well the Norelco I bought does not have this feature, so I'll keep the Braun handy.

The Braun will give you a pretty close shave - but like all electrics, your face must get used to it. you need to give it time.

After 3 weeks of use my face did get used to the shaver. But I decided I liked the Norelco better than a foil shaver. I think it gets the job done faster with less vibration. But if you like a foil shaver or have no preference, I can highly recommend the Braun.",3,
,,,,"3. I spent decades cutting myself with blades and throwing a mountain of plastic into the landfill, but this device changed all that. It takes a bit of time to master the use of an electric shaver but once you learn how to use it, this machine will give you a close shave and some very fast body hair trimming -- all without any cuts and bruises. Best of all, you only need to replace the head once every 18 months -- which is better for the environment, not to mention your pocket book.",4,
,,,,"4. Is it as good as a blade? NO. But, is it better than any other electric razor I have ever had? YES. Good for those times when you can't or won't operate a real razor. Just don't kiss your girl 4 hours later. Battery charger works well. It hold a charge for a long time with a number of shaves per charge. Great travelling razor for when you are in the middle of the desert with no electricity or water. Good razor - Good value.

47,Blender,,"A blender (sometimes called a liquidiser in British English) is a
 kitchen and laboratory appliance used to mix, purée, or emulsify
 food and other substances. A stationary blender consists of a 
blender jar with a rotating metal blade at the bottom, powered by an
 electric motor in the base. Some powerful models can also crush
 ice. The newer immersion blender configuration has a motor on top 
connected by a shaft to a rotating blade at the bottom, which can be
 used with any container.","1. I bought this blender to replace an Oster that I've had for 4 years. I had this Ninja for 28 days. I blend the same stuff every day for breakfast: Powdered protein, milk, frozen strawberries, and bananas. Today I turned the blender on, and one of the strawberries shattered the pitcher and left a 2 inch hole in the side. How can a blender not handle frozen fruit, but is advertised to be able to make ""snow"" from ice cubes?

So I called ninjakitchen.com at 1-800-798-7398. The customer support rep, named Valerie, tells me that if I bought the product from Amazon.com, that it is not under warranty but I am free to purchase another pitcher. I said, not under warranty? It's less than a 30 days old. Can I see that not in warranty statement in writing. She said you can go online and email the department yourself. I said can't you transfer me to that department? She said that she can't transfer me there. I asked for her supervisor, Bonnie. She said the same thing the plastic pitchers are not under warranty. I asked for the president, Mr. Rosen, but he won't take calls. I asked for her supervisor, she said that she is the last person to take calls. I said, this is going nowhere. So here is my one star review. Caveat Emptor.",1,
,,,,2.Don't waste your money on this blender. We used it 15 times to blend since we bought it. We did not chop ice or abuse it. Now it is dead! We had an Oster blender for over 30 years and it still worked when we bought this plastic piece of junk. Of course now it out of warranty but from what I read there IS NO WARRANTY If you buy through Amazon beyond the 30 day return policy. Gee I wonder why they don't warranty their product? I'm searching for a new blender. It won't be a Ninja.,1,
,,,,"3. I am very disappointed in the performance of this  Professional Blender! For the cost I was anticipating creating great smoothies. It has a very powerful motor indeed, but there are loads of tiny pieces floating around that I don't want to see in my smoothie. That's why I was willing to pay a bit more for a quality blender. The end result are very small chunks and pieces of fruits and veggies floating about. A smoothie is a perfect way for me to get my 10 year old to intake veggies that I have a difficult time getting him to eat, buy hiding them and masking the taste, no hiding things in here!

There's also a recall on this unit. The blade is very, very sharp. I actually cut my finger taking the blade out of the box. The real danger is that if you pour from the tank before taking the blade out, you risk getting slashed, as the blade loosely fits into the middle and will plunge out as you pour. The hassle and inability to smooth ingredients together is not worth the cost.",1,

49,LED Light,,"produce light when voltage is applied to negatively 
charged semiconductors, causing electrons to combine and create
 a unit of light (photon). In simpler terms, an LED is a chemical chip
 embedded in a plastic capsule. Because they are small, several
 LEDs are sometimes combined to produce a single light bulb.

LED lighting in general is more efficient and longer lasting than any 
other type of light source, and it is being developed for more and 
more applications within the home. LEDs are currently popular in 
under-cabinet strips and some types of downlights.

To ensure that you are purchasing an LED bulb with good color 
quality and energy efficiency that is as good or better than 
fluorescent bulbs, look for the ENERGY STAR symbol.","1. The meter's display is not back lit so it is impossible to read at night. The detached measuring head means that two hands are required to operate the unit. So taking notes while making measurements is difficult if not impossible. I returned the unit because I found that it could not be calibrated. Other Extech meters can be calibrated. Why not this one?? It is said to measure colored LED light levels, which is why I ordered it. It simply did not fit my application",3,
,,,,"2. Very good device - excellent form factor for performing walk-around surveys, portable and with good battery life. Features are user friendly and do not require a manual to figure out. Self-calibrating feature is an excellent touch for longevity.",5,
,,,,"3. I use these for restaurant inspections as a health inspector. It is small enough and light so I don't mind carrying it in my tool bag everyday. It's a luxury item, because most inspectors could care less about proper light levels when there are so many facilities with bad food temps. I mainly use it on new construction, when they have the ability to make adjustments more easily. Works well. Just pop off the protective black cover to reveal the white frosted dome and start reading.",5,
,,,,"4. For the price, works great.
Purchased this for use in acquiring night light meter readings on roadways. It allows for lux or foot candle measurements. The instruction manual covers the quirky min/max average function. Otherwise, it did a great job on the jobsite. The included bag provides for good storage and the device is sturdy and works good in a commercial environment.
The only issue is there is no back light, which made night readings a little difficult. The fact that the light meter was integrated into the device meant there was no additional wires to manage.",5,

major quality problem.",1,
