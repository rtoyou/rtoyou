 created will be the difference between a buyer purchasing your 
item, or clicking ‘back’ to continue wading through more listings.
Buyers are judging your listings on two main criteria: is this the
 item I want? and how trustworthy is the seller? So creating a 
good description means answering these two criteria. When a 
potential buyer first lands on your listing, they are scanning the
 page for indicators or red flags that this isn’t the listing for them.
 If they get to the point where they are reading the item 
description, then your listing has passed these initial checks.

40,Press Council of India,www.presscouncil.nic.in,"Press Council is a mechanism for the Press to regulate itself. 
The raison d’etre of this unique institution is rooted in the concept
 that in a democratic society the press needs at once to be free 
and responsible. If the Press is to function effectively as the 
watchdog of public interest, it must have a secure freedom of
 expression, unfettered and unhindered by any authority, 
organised bodies or individuals. But, this claim to press freedom
 has legitimacy only if it is exercised with a due sense of
 responsibility. The Press must, therefore, scrupulously 
adhere to accepted norms of journalistic ethics and maintian
 high standards of professional conduct.
Where the norms are breached and the freedom is defiled by
 unprofessional conduct, a way must exist to check and control
 it. But, control by Government or official authorities may prove 
destructive of this freedom. Therefore, the best way is to let the 
peers of the profession, assisted by a few discerning laymen to 
regulate it through a properly structured representative impartial 
machinery. Hence, the Press Council.
A need for such a mechanism has been felt for a long time both
 by the authorities as well as the Press itself all over the world, 
and a search for it resulted in the setting up of the first Press 
Council known as the Court of Honour for the Press in Sweden in 
1916. The idea gained quick acceptance in other Scandinavian
 countries, and later in other parts of Europe, Canada, Asia, 
Australia and New Zealand. Today, the Press Councils or similar
 other media bodies are in place in more than four dozen nations. ","The Secretary, Press Council of India, Soochna Bhavan, 8-C.G.O. Complex, Lodhi Road , New Delhi-110003",(011) 24366405 24366747,,,

43,Geological Survey of India,www.portal.gsi.gov.in,"The beginning of geological investigation in India was in the early part of the nineteenth century. A few amateur geologists associated with the Survey of India and Army initiated geological studies in the country. H.W. Voysey (1818-1823) of the Great Trigonometric Survey made the first Geological Map of Hyderabad region along with a detailed report. A committee for “The Investigation of Coal and Mineral Resources” was set up in 1837. The Secretary of the Committee John McClelland made the appointment of the first professional geologist. D. H. Williams was the first Geological Surveyor appointed by the East India Company in 1846. John McClelland for the first time used the term Geological Survey of India in his report in 1848. He designated himself as officiating Surveyor, Geological Survey till 1st April 1850. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) was set up in 1851 primarily to find coal deposits for the Railways. The arrival of Sir Thomas Oldham, Professor of Geology at Trinity College Dublin and the Chief of Irish Geological Survey at Calcutta on 4th March 1851, marked the beginning of the continuous period of the Geological Survey of India. Over the years, it has not only grown into a repository of geo-science information required in various fields in the country, but has also attained the status of a geo-scientific organisation of international repute. The main functions of GSI relate to creation and updation of national geoscientific information and mineral resource assessment. These objectives are achieved through ground surveys, air-borne and marine surveys, mineral prospecting and investigations, multi-disciplinary geoscientific, geo-technical, geo-environmental and natural hazards studies, glaciology, seismotectonic study, and carrying out fundamental research. Outcome of work of GSI has immense societal value. Functioning and annual programmes of GSI assume significance in the national perspective.","3, Plot No. 3, Sector 33B, Chandigarh, 160033",,"1.
