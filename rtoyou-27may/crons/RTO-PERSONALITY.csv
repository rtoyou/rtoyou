There some of the negative pointsstrong text which I don't like from company and Atta.

• Packing is not good because I find it damaged many times.

• Also there are some wheat weevil inside Atta which make it more difficult to consume.

• Its also costly compare to other available Atta in market.

• After meshing Atta for 1-2 hours superficially it becomes blackish on top. After this 2016 monsoon we are getting some bad quality Atta from Patanjali.

• If Patanjali wants to create good esteem other than local flour mills, they should have put some effort on quality control and customer satisfaction on basis of sample of wheat grains, year of crop and species of crop.

• In advertisement there are some 12 rupees and 18 rupee/k.g. Atta is coming but in market its not available.

It gives us a glimpse of Sundar's attributes and here is my version of it - Sundar will do what he believes in, and he believes in what he does. At Google, he is known to weather constraints and convert what others may see as a disadvantage into an opportunity. Pichai's current success owes a great deal to his ability to lead difficult projects successfully by listening to people and derive cues from what is happening around him. And Larry believes that Sundar has the ability to manage people and get them to collaborate with each other in a manner that borders on leadership mastery along with the talent for creating products that are technically excellent yet easy to use as in case of Chromebooks based on SSD which proved that the fastest Windows laptop would possibly be slower than the slowest Chromebook.

Irani faced public outrage and the opposition’s ire over her handling of the episode related to Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula’s suicide.

Opposition parties alleged Irani distorted facts.
In another row, involving the JNU students’ union, Irani became the target of the Opposition as she tried to defend the central government’s action. Her over-zealous pitch for patriotism prompted Opposition to call her ‘Aunty national’.",4,

In her April 2004 affidavit to the EC Irani said she completed her BA in 1996 through a long-distance or correspondence programme from Delhi University. In 2014, ahead of the general elections, she claimed she had completed a bachelor’s degree in commerce from the School of Open Learning, Delhi University.

Virat recently surpassed the cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar as the most followed sportsperson on Twitter.",,1. Virat Kohli is now my favorite cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar.

Even God of cricket machine has admired him and said only he can break his records.He is Also the captain of RCB in IPL.

I personally believe that if you are aggressive for something, it shows your passion towards that. And if you are passionate towards your work, there is nothing which will stop you. That's what I found in virat kohli. He is too much passionate towards his work/goals/dream.

Everyone has their own plus points and flaws. Its upto you only. that how you are going to use it. No One is perfect. As he uses his aggressiveness towards his game, I would say it is totally right. These feelings come from heart and it is very for one to control. Virat is also one of them.",4,
,,,,"4. Cricket has always been the most loved game by indians.There always been a tesned state on cricket fans face what will happen if our master blaster Tendulkar gets retire from cricket.

But we always have alternatives if a best players retires new best playera emerges and such a player is VIRAT KOHLI young, stylish and a sensational batting style with great positive attitude.from the day he came to indian cricket team his batting and runs are reflected clearly.

First virat started with the 19 world cup he lifted it up and made his place in indian team.being such a young player he has still now scored 22 hundreds and more than 6500 runs.He is a run machine for indian team.

Virat kohli reached many milestones in such a small time span fast to score 20 hundreds, fastest to score 5000 runs, fastest to score 6000 runs.all indians fave faith in him that he will be the next sachim for indian team but I say no both players are different and have equal potential and dedication towards cricket.

I would say he is the one of the most favourite batsman of indian cricket team.many indian hearts have attached to it.keep playing keep scoring.

He is considered the one who made BJP acceptable in Goa – a state with a significant Christian vote. Within one month of assuming office, the ex-Goa Chief Minister zeroed in on indigenisation of defence equipment to reduce the dependence on imports. Besides aiming 100 percent indigenisation in some equipment, the IIT Bombay alumnus has also set his eyes on building infrastructure to start exporting defence equipment.",,"1.Manohar Patrikar has been a great move on from AK Antony.
he looks to be a man of substance and his stern statements against terrorist activities and proxy wars are encouraging. He, as a Defence Minister , has made it very clear that India is not here to preach peace and further he was also lauded for his statement ""terrorists should be neutralised through terrorists"" .
Thus I firmly believe that the reigns of the ministry of defence are in the hands of a able man.",5,

The biopic on Mary Kom grossed a whopping Rs.104 crores worldwide within one month of its release. Both Padma Bhushan and Arjuna Award came her way in 2013. She is the only Indian woman boxer to have qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.",,"1. India has produced many legends in the field of sports. But barring the ones in cricket and few others in other games, we hardly can recall prominent names who have made a mark. Mary Kom is one such personality who became a known name for most Indians only after her victory in the 2012 London Olympics. Her story is extraordinary, her struggle is unparalleled. In short, she deserves a biopic that would make her story known to people all around the world. Debutant director Omung Kumar takes up the challenge and comes up with a fairly nice tribute to the boxing champion. Sadly, it could have been the film of the year but few factors doesn’t allow that to happen.

The story of the movie: Mangte Chungne Zang(Priyanka Chopra) is based in Manipur and is interested in boxing. Her father(Robin Das) however is averse to his daughter’s hot temper and obsession for boxing. Unknown to him, Mangte starts learning boxing under Coach Singh(Sunil Thapa) who rechristens her as Mary Kom. She even falls for Onler(Darshan Kumar). Although she is a pro at boxing, she has lot of hurdles in her way. She is from a country where her home state Manipur is not considered a part of India. She is from a country where women boxing is unheard of. Her father strongly disapproves of her boxing and Coach Singh disapproves of her desire to get settled and start a family. How Mary bravely faces these odds and manages to become world champion not once or twice but as many as 5 times is what the film is all about.",5,

He joined Bimal Roy Productions in 1961 and got his first break as a lyricist writing for Bimal Roy's Bandini (1963). The success of this film made him Bimalda's full-time assistant and got him writing for films by acclaimed directors like Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Asit Kumar Sen.

(1990) and Maachis (1996) had their moments, his last film to date, Hu Tu Tu (1999), was a misfire.

He has also turned his creativity into other channels--he has written screenplays for films like Masoom (1983) and Rudaali (1993), and has written the lyrics for films like Dil Se.. (1998) and Saathiya (2002).",,"1.I bet all those who like Pancham like Gulzar too(Pancham ke saath Gulzar free offer!).
