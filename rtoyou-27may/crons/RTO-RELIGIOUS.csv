This place looks small on the outside but once you go inside (especially the upstairs), you will be amazed by the number of rooms & deities. A lot of deities are depicted using beautiful & colorful stained glass on the wall. You also have to crawl through a short cave and walk through a room with ankle deep water to add to a little bit of adventure. But to contrast that, there is also a great sense 
of peace and tranquility in the temple. Definitely a must see

All religious minded peoples are allowed to come to fulfill their wish to be granted by the Almighty...
Here if you wish can contribute any amounts for the well being of this Dargah by the name of God. This place is very crowdy and you must have to be careful about pickpocketing...
I really disliked the auto fare business culture among the drivers in Ajmer, while coming to Dargah. They ask more charges and try to manipulate tourists over there.
",4,
,,,,,"2. Although an overcrowded, full of beggars and located on an odd place, one will always remember the dargah shariff for the purity and sacredness you feel inside. It is true that the management should work better on managing the crowd. It can be much better and well organized place.

Good for solo and male travelers who are looking for a budget hotel. Located in a busy and noisy street but easy access to most tourist locations in Pondicherry.,4,
,,,,,"2. I know, I know, this is India, and if you're paying 700 rupees a night you've got to expect things to be a little rough around the edges. We looked at the room before paying, and sure, it seemed a bit dingy, but it smelled of Neem cleaner and looked tolerable. But after settling in and lifting the top bedsheet and finding all sorts of crumbs or flakes of something, that cast some doubts. The holes and stains in the pillowcases were pretty gross but we just tried not to think about it. The water pouring out of the toilet tank when you flush wasn't too encouraging either. But the worst thing was that the ""quiet"" room we'd specifically requested, which had seemed decent in the afternoon, got really loud as everyone came in via the elevator during the night, holding the door open so that the elevator kept repeating some prerecorded music and message over and over until my partner asked them to keep it down and the guy at the front desk basically laughed at him. If it hadn't been 11:00 PM we might have tried to switch hotels that very night, but it was a bit late for that, so we somehow made it through the night and got the hell out of there in the morning. Best I can say about the place is that I don't THINK it had bedbugs... but I couldn't say that with confidence (when the mattress is red, how can you tell?), and I have put the clothes I was wearing in the freezer for a while, just in case.",1,
,,,,,"3. This property is located in Grand Bazaar, Jawaharlal Nehru St right next to the market area and is less than a 15min walk to Aurobindo Ashram as well as the other sites to be seen like the Pondicherry Beach.
However, the fact is that this is a lodge and not a Hotel. So don't expect any sort of Hotel service, beds, etc. I had booked a Double bed AC room & was charged 1125 (after a 25% disc on the 1500 room charge). This is certainly much higher than other good 'actual' hotels in the area.
Staff were courteous, spoke English well..",3,
,,,,,"4. My stay in Sri Saibaba guest house was really awesome, the main advantage of this property is it is located in the main place of pondicherry which is J.N.
