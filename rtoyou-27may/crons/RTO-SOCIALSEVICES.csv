कृषि है। कृषि मानसून पर निर्भर करती है- कहीं सूखा तो कहीं बाढ़। दोनों ही

From that rudimentary shelter, the journey began towards gaining entry into other construction sites and ensuring basic minimum care for the children of the vast migrant labour force belonging to the poorest strata of the society. In 1972, a branch was set up in Mumbai called Mobile Creches, Mumbai. From the 1st April, 2007, we began separate operations as Mumbai Mobile Creches. This was for administrative simplicity.
 
Vrishali Pispati worked as General Manager (Finance) with MMC before taking over as the Chief Executive Officer on March 1, 2010. She feels that it is deeply ironic that the children of the very construction workers who produce the symbols of economic development – the tall commercial and residential skyscrapers are denied the right to participate in and enjoy the fruits of development. MMC plays a very important role in providing stimulation, care, nutrition, education to the children on sites, enabling them to enjoy a childhood that they deserve.","Debdatta Purkayastha
