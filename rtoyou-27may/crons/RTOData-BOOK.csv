1,The God of Small Things,,"""They all crossed into forbidden territory. They all tampered with the laws that lay 
down who should be loved and how. And how much."" The year is 1969. In the state of 
Kerala, on the southernmost tip of India, fraternal twins Esthappen and Rahel fashion
 a childhood for themselves in the shade of the wreck that is their family. Their lonely,
 lovely mother, Ammu, (who loves by night the man her children love by day), fled an 
abusive marriage to live with their blind grandmother, Mammachi (who plays Handel 
on her violin), their beloved uncle Chacko (Rhodes scholar, pickle baron, radical 
Marxist, bottom-pincher), and their enemy, Baby Kochamma (ex-nun and incumbent 
grandaunt). When Chacko's English ex-wife brings their daughter for a Christmas 
visit, the twins learn that things can change in a day, that lives can twist into new, 
ugly shapes, even cease forever, beside their river",Arundhati Roy,"1. The God Of Small Things is a very very clever book, but what makes it exceptional is 
that it is both beautiful and crafty, a rare combination. This book has structure. Lots of it.

and legs tied to a slowly moving, possibly dying horse, and being dragged face-down 
through the jungle. I mean, like that, only nice. You can't stop seeing and smelling 
everything, and it's all so foreign and rich. Potentially ripe with e coli",4,

things about it. And yet I really didn't like it. It's not a bad book - far from it. The characters 
she has created are really wonderful, and she has succeeded in evoking all the noises 
and sights and smells of Kerala, even for someone like me who's never been further 
east than Poland. The narrative structure is disjointed, wandering from the now to 
1969 and back again, but I never found myself getting confused by it.",3,

 most brilliant of her generation. Her stories are one of the very few debut 
works -- and only a handful of collections -- to have won the Pulitzer Prize 
for fiction. Among the many other awards and honors it received were the New
 Yorker Debut of the Year award, the PEN/Hemingway Award, and the highest 
critical praise for its grace, acuity, and compassion in detailing lives transported 
from India to America. In The Namesake, Lahiri enriches the themes that made 
her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience, the clash 
of cultures, the conflicts of assimilation, and, most poignantly, the tangled ties
 between generations. Here again Lahiri displays her deft touch for the perfect

6,Interpreter of Maladies ,,"Mr. Kapasi, the protagonist of Jhumpa Lahiri's title story, would certainly have 
his work cut out for him if he were forced to interpret the maladies of all the 
characters in this eloquent debut collection. Take, for example, Shoba and 
Shukumar, the young couple in ""A Temporary Matter"" whose marriage is 
crumbling in the wake of a stillborn child. Or Miranda in ""Sexy,"" who is
 involved in a hopeless affair with a married man. But Mr. Kapasi has problems 
enough of his own; in addition to his regular job working as an interpreter for a
 doctor who does not speak his patients' language, he also drives tourists to local
 sites of interest. His fare on this particular day is Mr. and Mrs. Das--first-
generation Americans of Indian descent--and their children. During the course 
of the afternoon, Mr. Kapasi becomes enamored of Mrs. Das and then becomes 
her unwilling confidant when she reads too much into his profession. ""I told you

Mehra, are both trying to find -- through love or through exacting maternal 
appraisal -- a suitable boy for Lata to marry. Set in the early 1950s, in an India 
newly independent and struggling through a time of crisis, A Suitable Boy takes 
us into the richly imagined world of four large extended families and spins a 
compulsively readable tale of their lives and loves. A sweeping panoramic 
portrait of a complex, multi ethnic society in flux, A Suitable Boy remains the 
story of ordinary people caught up in a web of love and ambition, humor and 
sadness, prejudice and reconciliation, the most delicate social etiquette and the
 most appalling violence.",Vikram Seth,"1. I have read this book about 10 years back, and very recently I had the good fortune to 
meet the author on the sidelines of a literary festival. Negatives: The book goes on forever. 
Positive: If he wrote more, I would have continued to read. Well to be honest, I don't have 
much more of a recollection of the novel at this point, but I sure can remember the 
emotions, as the book does go down in my history as the longest ever read by me. ",4,

has been a really fascinating read for me.",4,

8,Malgudi Days ,,"Introducing this collection of stories, R. K. Narayan describes how in India “the
 writer has only to look out of the window to pick up a character and thereby a 
story.” Composed of powerful, magical portraits of all kinds of people, and 
comprising stories written over almost forty years, Malgudi Days presents 
Narayan’s imaginary city in full color, revealing the essence of India and of 
human experience. This edition includes an introduction by Pulitzer Prize- 
winning author Jhumpa Lahiri. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been 
the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With 
more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best
 works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the 
series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by
distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date 
translations by award-winning translators.",R.K. Narayan,"1. I had really high expectations when I picked this up and, of course, I was initially
 disappointed. I eventually started to enjoy these short (4-6 page) stories because each 
has fully developed characters experiencing mini-dramas. All the stories take place in the 
same town and a few of the characters pop up in multiple stories. I ended up liking this and 
appreciating it for what it is - a thoughtful, sweet, well written collection of short stories. I 
was telling my mom about it and she said that there is a television series on the indian 
channel by the same name where these stories are brought to life (television life, anyway). 
She has been watching it for a while and always thought they were true stories. ",4,

 reader, on a non-white author's work - may smack of insensitivity to difference, but they feel
 universal the way greatest Russian literature does; they present human weaknesses and 
imperfection in a humorous, but, more frequently, objective and non-judgmental way.",3,

classic autobiography he recounts the story of his life and how he developed his 
concept of active nonviolent resistance, which propelled the Indian struggle for 
independence and countless other nonviolent struggles of the twentieth century.
In a new foreword, noted peace expert and teacher Sissela Bok urges us to adopt 
Gandhi's ""attitude of experimenting, of testing what will and will not bear close
 scrutiny, what can and cannot be adapted to new circumstances,"" in order to 
bring about change in our own lives and communities. All royalties earned on 
this book are paid to the Navajivan Trust, founded by Gandhi, for use in carrying

author with eight dazzling stories that take us from Cambridge and Seattle to 
India and Thailand as they explore the secrets at the heart of family life. In the

who carefully tends her garden–where she later unearths evidence of a love affair 
he is keeping to himself. In “A Choice of Accommodations,” a couple’s romantic 
getaway weekend takes a dark turn at a party that lasts deep into the night. In 
“Only Goodness,” a woman eager to give her younger brother the perfect
 childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish and anger when his 
alcoholism threatens her family. And in “Hema and Kaushik,” a trio of linked
 stories–a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love and fate–we
 follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one fateful winter, share a house in 
Massachusetts. They travel from innocence to experience on separate, sometimes
painful paths, until destiny brings them together again years later in Rome.",Jhumpa Lahiri,"1. These eight short stories by Jhumpa Lahiri are quiet, penetrating, and meticulously 
written. The first five stories are distinct, while the last three are interrelated. Lahiri's prose 
seems so clean and precise that it is very easy to turn page after page despite the fact
 that her stories are not really plot-driven. Rather, each story delves into the psyche of each
 character with such skill that the reader can't help but feel extremely intimate with each 
one, whether male or female, likable or otherwise.",4,
,,,,,"2. I have often stated that I do not enjoy short stories, but although this is designated as 
such, it oversimplifies the content of this book. With understated elegance, Lahiri has drawn 
in the reader to become immersed in tales of families, lovers and friends. She has the 
unique ability to simply, but fascinatingly communicate the features of the characters' 
behaviors, thoughts and emotions. In addition, she is able to express such dimensions so 
wellthat I felt I had become acquainted with these people. I was immediately captivated by 
her style and the tales that she wove. It was an emotional experience for me to read each
 story, from sheer delight, or humor, to grief and regret",4,
,,,,,"3. Eight short stories of remarkable depth, richness and resonance. Part one consists of 
five stand-alone stories, some of which have the density of novellas; part two consists of 
three stories that chronicle several decades in the lives of two characters whose lives have 
been fatefully intertwined.Lahiri's protagonists might all be Bengalis from India taking root in
 America and then often 
abroad, but their secrets, hopes and dreams are universal. The stories' endings are
 particularly powerful, full of surprises that never feel gimmicky. ",3,

 orphaned granddaughter, Sai, arrives on his doorstep. The judge’s cook watches
 over her distractedly, for his thoughts are often on his son, Biju, who is 
hopscotching from one gritty New York restaurant to another. Kiran Desai’s 
brilliant novel, published to huge acclaim, is a story of joy and despair. Her 
characters face numerous choices that majestically illuminate the consequences 
of colonialism as it collides with the modern world.",Kiran Desai,"1. The Inheritance Of Loss by Kiran Desai is a magnificent, impressive novel that ultimately
 is disappointing. As a process, the book is almost stunningly good. As a product, it falls 
short.",3,

colonial India and in the United States was really interesting and supported with well-
developed characters... but. I just couldn't get into it and found it like pulling teeth to get 
through.",3,
,,,,,"3. Truth be told, I feel like I hated this novel. Alas, I realize that I am being unduly, 
especially
 biased against it for a few reasons. The primary reason is how lauded it is, including
 winning an award that I have a special respect for: The Man Booker Prize (2006). This is 
thus far the most undeserving winner that I have read.",4,

12,Wings of Fire: An Autobiography,,"Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, the son of a little-educated boat-owner in 
Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, had an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, 
culminating in the highest civilian award of India, the Bharat Ratna. As chief of 
the country's defence research and development programme, Kalam 
demonstrated the great potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in 
seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the story of Kalam's rise
 from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the story 
of Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag-missiles that have become household 
names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile power of 
international reckoning. This is also the saga of independent India's struggle for 
technological self-sufficiency and defensive autonomy-a story as much about 
politics, domestic and international, as it is about science.",A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,"1. A mediocre autography containing infinite amount of mechanical 
terms that one must decode at first to comprehend the simplest of 
sentences. Despite the countless hurdles, the high rating comes as a 
surprise. As I understand, a lot of people have evaluated the writing 
basing on the utmost respect they have for this man of extraordinary 
excellence and on the contents of Mr Kalam's character rather than the 
book itself.",4,
,,,,,"2. Amazing book there are a lot of things to be learned from these books . Ill just mention 
few lines which i really liked from the book. We are all born with a divine fire in us. Our 
efforts should be to give wings to this fire"". ",4,
,,,,,"3. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam's book, WINGS OF FIRE is more than an 
autobiography. Written with the main intention of bestowing clarity 
and vision to the Youth in general, Indian Youth in particular, the 
book is inter alia, a history of Indian rocket launching and defense
research; and partly a work of sound philosophy that would inspire 
any Indian.

13,Swami and Friends ,,"""There are writers—Tolstoy and Henry James to name two—whom we hold in
 awe, writers—Turgenev and Chekhov—for whom we feel a personal affection, 
other writers whom we respect—Conrad for example—but who hold us at a long 
arm's length with their 'courtly foreign grace.' Narayan (whom I don't hesitate 
to name in such a context) more than any of them wakes in me a spring of 
gratitude, for he has offered me a second home. Without him I could never have 
known what it is like to be Indian.""—Graham Greene Offering rare insight into
 the complexities of Indian middle-class society, R. K. Narayan traces life in the 
fictional town of Malgudi. The Dark Room is a searching look at a difficult 
marriage and a woman who eventually rebels against the demands of being a
 good and obedient wife. In Mr. Sampath, a newspaper man tries to keep his
 paper afloat in the face of social and economic changes sweeping India. Narayan
 writes of youth and young adulthood in the semiautobiographical Swami and
 Friends and The Bachelor of Arts. Although the ordinary tensions of maturing
 are heightened by the particular circumstances of pre-partition India, Narayan 
provides a universal vision of childhood, early love and grief.",R.K. Narayan,"1. I would never have known about Narayan had not the parent of a child with whom I 
worked introduced me with a Christmas present of the Everyman's Library Edition of the 
four 'Malgugi' novels. Another lucky reward of my job. The first of these novels, 'Swami' is
 the story of a ten-year-old boy in a small town in southern India, just as Gandhi's 
independence movement is gaining traction. ",4,

of the 'big problems' you had to face when you were a child and all those ridiculous things
 you did.",4,

English novelist from India. The novel, which is also Narayan's first, is set in pre-
independence days in India, in a fictional town - Malgudi, which has almost become a real
 place in India today, due to the wide recognition and popularity of Narayan's many novels. 
His novels are known for their 'deftly etched characters, his uniquely stylized language and

 step-children, Coomy and Jal, have a spacious apartment (in the inaptly named

The inhabitants of that period called it the land of Meluha a near perfect empire 
created many centuries earlier by Lord Ram, one of the greatest monarchs that
 ever lived. This once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe perils
 as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They 
also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the
 Chandravanshis. To make matters worse, the Chandravanshis appear to have 
allied with the Nagas, an ostracised and sinister race of deformed humans with
 astonishing martial skills! The only hope for the Suryavanshis is an ancient 
legend: When evil reaches epic proportions, when all seems lost, when it 
appears that your enemies have triumphed, a hero will emerge. Is the rough-
hewn Tibetan immigrant Shiva, really that hero? And does he want to be that 
hero at all? Drawn suddenly to his destiny, by duty as well as by love, will Shiva

23,The Guide ,,"R.K. Narayan (1906-2001) is unusual among Indian authors writing in English 
in that he has stayed contentedly in his home country, venturing abroad only 
rarely. He rarely addresses political issues or tries to explore the cutting edge 
of fiction. He is a traditional teller of tales, a creator of realist fiction which is 
often gentle, humorous, and warm rather than hard-hitting or profound. 
Almost all of his writings are set in the fictional city of Malgudi, and are
 narrowly focused on the lives of relatively humble individuals, neither 
extremely poor nor very rich.The Guide is one of his most interesting books,
 which begins as a comic look at the life of a rogue, but evolves into something 
quite different. It should be noted that Narayan is not a devout Hindu, and has 
accused Westerners of wrongly supposing that all Indians are deeply spiritual 
beings; but it is also true that he was deeply impressed by some experiences he 
had with a medium after the sudden death of his young wife (described movingly
 in The English Teacher (1945).",R.K. Narayan,,3,

India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to
 make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he
 fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry her—not least of
 which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local 
nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to

and his shocked reaction to certain curious American customs are amusing and

ducking for cover to his blushing mishap with his appropriately named American
 friend Randy, Gopal's experiences prove to be a lesson for all on the often

petty squabbles and unrelenting conflicts of modern-day India. At the center 
of the narrative is the character of Vishnu, an aging alcoholic houseboy on the 
precipice of death, who lies, penniless, on the bottom step of a middle-class 
Bombay apartment house. While Vishnu appears to face his impending death 
placidly and philosophically, a maelstrom swirls around him. The residents of 
the building include a reclusive widower mourning the untimely death of his
 young wife, a Moslem family coping with the daily prejudices of their Hindu 
neighbors, and two families who unhappily share a kitchen. Worlds collide 
when the Moslem family's son elopes with the Hindu family's daughter, and 
Mr. Jalal, the Moslem family patriarch, apparently flips his wig, recognizing 
Vishnu not as their dying houseboy but as the deity whose name he bears, 
with the power to save. And when Mr. Jalal is found sleeping on the stairs 
beside Vishnu, he becomes the scapegoat for the building's many ills. In its 
frenetic and hilarious conclusion, The Death of Vishnu trumpets the arrival 
of an extremely gifted Indian writer, bringing to spectacular life the 
tempestuous chaos that is life in India today.",Manil Suri,,3,

98,Meeting With Christ and Other Poems ,,"Prof. Hugh Fox (Professor Emeritus of Michigan State University, archaeologist, 
editor, writer, and iconic poet of international fame) has liked and appreciated this 
book in these words:
“One of the deepest, widest, most universal poetry books ever written about 
individual spirituality in a world-wide context. And Chaswal has the single most 
original view of Christianity in all its totality and specifics of anyone else on the 
contemporary scene. What he wants is individual sanity, salvation, an escape from
 the depravities of the modern world into an ancient oneness with the universe, a 
kind of reworking of human spirituality, so that it really functions and Man as such
 can glide into, drift into individual completeness. Christ isn't someone distant for 
Chaswal but someone he goes to Jerusalem to meet and converse with, all about a 
return to essential humanity. He hates greed, selfishness, in a sense the whole 
mechanical-cybernetic drifting of the modern world into a flow that is turning
 humankind into something minor and self-involved that it was never intended to 
be. Chaswal identifies with blacks, whites, Indians in India, Americans....you name
 it, he identifies with it. Universalism at its most universal. You read his poetry and 
you go through a kind of spiritual renewal. One of, perhaps, THE most spiritually 
renewing poet on the contemporary scene. WONDERFUL WORK! I really loved it.”",Deepak Chaswal,,4,

100,Holy Cow: An Indian Adventure ,,"In her twenties, journalist Sarah Macdonald backpacked around India and came away with a lasting
 impression of heat, pollution and poverty. So when an airport beggar read her palm and told her she 
would return to India—and for love—she screamed, “Never!” and gave the country, and him, the finger.
 But eleven years later, the prophecy comes true. When the love of Sarah’s life is posted to India, she 
quits her dream job to move to the most polluted city on earth, New Delhi. For Sarah this seems like the 
ultimate sacrifice for love, and it almost kills her, literally. Just settled, she falls dangerously ill with
 double pneumonia, an experience that compels her to face some serious questions about her own
 fragile mortality and inner spiritual void. “I must find peace in the only place possible in India,” she
 concludes. “Within.” Thus begins her journey of discovery through India in search of the meaning of life 
and death.",Sarah Macdonald,,3,
