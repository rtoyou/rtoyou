item, but also to sell yourself as a seller. eBay is an extremely 
crowded marketplace which means buyers may look at tens or

 created will be the difference between a buyer purchasing your 
item, or clicking ‘back’ to continue wading through more listings.
Buyers are judging your listings on two main criteria: is this the
 item I want? and how trustworthy is the seller? So creating a 
good description means answering these two criteria. When a 
potential buyer first lands on your listing, they are scanning the
 page for indicators or red flags that this isn’t the listing for them.
 If they get to the point where they are reading the item 
description, then your listing has passed these initial checks.
