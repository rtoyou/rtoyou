1,Sigiriya Sri Lanka,,"Sigiriya, meaning ‘lion rock’ in Sinhalese, is an ancient rock fortress 
and palace surrounded by jungle in central Sri Lanka. Rising from the 
central plains, Sigiriya is one of Sri Lanka's most iconic sights with 
practically vertical cliff walls topped by a perfectly flat summit where 
the ancient ruins of a Kassapa city still stand. Reached by a vertigo
-inducing staircase that winds its way up the rock you'll be rewarded 
with stunning views. The entrance to the tip of the palace was
 designed in the shape of a lion’s mouth, hence its name.","Sigiriya, Sri Lanka",94 662231815,"1. Wonderful view both from the top and the bottom.  It is pretty 
expensive for tourists, but still a must have. The paintings are 
great, the bees might be a little problem. Very nice!",5,
,,,,,,"2. Five star place,must go place in Sri Lanka. Big Historical site. 
Be careful the stairs. Great view when you arrive the top palace 
site. Can't imagine the king built such a palace on the top of the 
rock. And this place sleep thousands years then found by a 
British guy. Amazing.keep power to climb.",4,
,,,"
",,,"3.I think this place is overpriced for the foreigners. The ticket price
 for foreigners is US $30. It is just a huge rock. Try to avoid tour 
guide. They will ask 2000 sri lankan ruppies and you don't need
a guide. ",1,

world wonder..😃😃",5,

2,Kerala Backwaters,,"The Kerala backwaters are a chain of brackish lagoons and lakes 
lying parallel to the Arabian Sea coast (known as the Malabar Coast) 
of Kerala state in southern India. The network includes five large lakes
 linked by canals, both manmade and natural, fed by 38 rivers, and 
extending virtually half the length of Kerala state. The backwaters were 
formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier 
islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the 
Western Ghats range.","Kerala, India 688006, India",,"1. Cruising the backwaters on a shikara was quite an experience
 for us. Once you are out in the vast open and see the views, you 
thank yourself that you made this trip and Alapuzzha doesn't 
disappoint in this respect, to say the least. Admittedly, the anchor 
area of boats is moss-infested and smelly, but the beautiful
 scenery with swaying coconut trees and green views from the 
waters are a visual treat. Must experience once. ",4,
,,,,,,"2. We booked a Houseboat tour from company AMRUTHAM 
HOUSEBOAT and it was really excellent in all terms. We 
celebrated our Honeymoon in Lake. Boat was specially for us 
with a top deck. All meals freshly done for us hot from kitchen. 
Stay in a Kerala boat is the best way to enjoy the nature I think. ",5,
,,,,,,"3. Excellent views during the trip. Slowly drifting by people's 
homes. They have boats instead of buses and scooters. 
Houseboat interesting mode of transport. In the evening a lot 
of mosquitoes ",5,
,,,,,,"4. Go with Spice Coast Cruises on the most authentic rice boats
 on the backwaters. The staff will take you on a wonderful trip 
round the backwaters. The air conditioned bedroom is 
comfortable and every meal cooked on board is a delight of 
Keralan cooking. A great way to wind down at the end of an Indian
 touring holiday. ",4,

3,Punakha Suspension Bridge,,"Punakha Dzong is also known as the palace of great happiness. 
The elegantly designed palace is the current administrative centre of 
Punakha District. Constructed in 1637 by Ngawang Namgyal the 1st 
Zhabdrung Rinpoche. The palace is the second oldest and second 
largest dzong in Bhutan. Located at the confluence of the Pho Chhu 
and Mo Chhu, Punakha Dzong is known to be the most picturesque 
Dzong in the Country.","Punakha Dzong, Punakha 13001, Bhutan",,"1. We got taken to the bridge by our guide. We walked across the
 full length of the bridge and back. Amazing views on a clear day. 
Good fun and not the average bridge you get at home",5,
,,,,,,"2. Just a normal suspension bridge not very special. Since is 
not too far from the Punakha Dzong, no harm to visit and try to 
pass but nothing to see at the other side. Just take a shut and 
comeback. ",4,
,,,"
",,,"3. The Suspension Bridge can be avoided in the summer 
season as its nothing too exciting. Since its close to the 
Punakha Dzong it can be done but only if you have nothing
else to do! ",2,

4,Rajasthan,,"Pushkar has a magnetism all of its own – it’s quite unlike anywhere 
else in Rajasthan. It’s a prominent Hindu pilgrimage town and devout 
Hindus should visit at least once in their lifetime. The town curls 
around a holy lake, said to have appeared when Brahma dropped a 
lotus flower. It also has one of the world’s few Brahma temples. With
 52 bathing ghats and 400 milky-blue temples, the town often hums 
with puja (prayers) generating an episodic soundtrack of chanting, 
drums and gongs, and devotional songs.","Ajmer District, Pushkar 305022, India",9462750383,"1. Pooja for peace of Acestoral departed soul was highly 
satisfying , Handicraft Shops and Items near lake and temple are 
good for window shopping ",5,
,,,,,,"2. Dont take any offers from ""priests"" here, After blessing process, 
they asked to donate $100 per family member, they even checked
my wallet because i told him i didnt have that much money. ",1,
,,,,,,"3. Pushkar lake, very tranquil, a must is a boat trip around the 
lake, trust me, you will not be disappointed. ",4,
,,,,,,"4. It's ok ok type lake. Nothing much doable there also the place is
 full of crowds all time. The hygiene is also not good around the 
hotel. ",3,
,,,,,,"5. Another place in India ruined by beggers disguised as ""holy 
men"" asking for 11000 rupees per family member. Just don't be
 stupid and don't take the flowers. Nice to look at though ",2,

5,"Ross and Smith Island Beach
Andaman & Nicobar",,"The most famous sight to behold at North Andaman is without a 
doubt the majestic twin islands of Ross and Smith connected by a 
thin fifty meter long sand bar. This silky white sand bar descends
 inside the sea at times of high tide and surfaces up again during low
 tide. The bar divides the shallow swimming area on one side and 
some amazing snorkeling on the other. The warm waters are crystal
 clear and the untamed virgin beaches are the most picture perfect 
ones you will see on the islands. The best part is that the beach is
 seldom crowded and most of the time you can cherish the whole
 sight by yourself. Tropical forests surround the beach and the inner 
islands are a preferred place for nature trail hiking. Smith Island has
 limited facilities; spacious bamboo huts with plenty of shade, 
changing rooms and toilets can be found.","Aerial Bay, Diglipur",9007742360,"1. These twin sisters up north Andaman is an awesome sight to 
behold. Easily approachable from the jetty, find a nice shady spot 
and relax watching the time standstill between blue sky and 
shallow green ocean! ",4,
,,,"
",,,"2. Mostly tourist visits Ross Island, Jollybouy Island and Havlok. 
But without visiting Ross & Smith Island, your Andaman trip is 
incomplete. You can say paradise in earth. ",5,
,,,,,,"3. Its one of the best place in earth to visit. Located in the North 
most part of Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Can get to this island 
by a fiber boat from Aerial Bay, Diglipur. An island with white sand 
lying between two islands...Good place for snorkling and taking 
sun bath....njoyed being there again and again. ",5,

6,Kaziranga National Park Assam,,"Kaziranga National Park is one of the prides of India. Kaziranga is the 
place where the nature unwinds its pristine form in millions of hues, 
where wildlife roams fearlessly, where man and nature meets together.
 This prestigious national park of India is situated in the north eastern part 
of the country in the district of Golaghat and Nagoan in the state of Assam. 
Let’s go back to the beginnings of the twentieth century in the year of 1904 
when this beautiful wildlife sanctuary was created, and about 68 years later
 it was declared as National Park by the Government of Assam. It is 
noteworthy to mention that it is the host for two third of world’s population 
of endangered Indian one-horned rhinoceros and also declared as a tiger
 reserve in 2006, holding the highest density of tigers in the world. The park
 is also a domicile for large breeding inhabitants of Elephants, wild water 
buffaloes and Swamp Deer. It has been declared as a forest reserve in the
 year of 1908 and wildlife sanctuary in the year of 1950. Covering an 
approximate area of 430 square kilometers, Kaziranga was declared as a
 World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its unique natural environment in the
 year of 1985. Apart from this, the park has been identified as an important
 bird area by Birdlife International Society as it is a home to various species 
of migrating and inhabitant birds. Situated on the banks of river Brahmaputra,
 the sanctuary is blessed with the four different kinds of vegetation. The 
Tropical moist mixed deciduous forests and tropical semi-evergreen 
forests is marked by the 41% of the tall grasses, 29% open jungle, 11% 
short grasses and rest is covered with the rivers and the water bodies. Its 
breathtaking array of flora and diverse fauna adds value to the scenic 
beauty of the park. ","Golaghat and Nagaon district, Guwahati 
110092,  Assam India",887652279,"1. Dense, huge and beautiful are all the words that come to mind.
Travel to the Park is also mesmerising",5,
,,,,,,"2. Your visit to Assam would be incomplete if you do not plan a
visit to Kaziranga National Park for sighting of the famous one 
horned rhino. The animal of assam. ",5,
,,,,,,"3. We stayed in green village for 2 nights and had taken up 4
 rooms for a family of 10.
The room size was good, however there was no heater provided. 
The floor had collapsed in one of our rooms and there was water
 leakage issue. We were not given a new room instead.
The service was also not good, we had to go to the hotel/front 
desk multiple times to get things done.
The only saving grace was that the hotel arranged for a last 
minute elephant tour and a big dance for us

7,Amritsar Golden Temple,,"The Golden Temple Amritsar India (Sri Harimandir Sahib Amritsar) is not 
only a central religious place of the Sikhs, but also a symbol of human 
brotherhood and equality. Everybody, irrespective of cast, creed or race 
can seek spiritual solace and religious fulfilment without any hindrance. 
It also represents the distinct identity, glory and heritage of the Sikhs. To 
pen-down the philosophy, ideology, the inner and outer beauty, as well as 
the historical legacy of Sri Harimandir Sahib is a momentous task. It is a 
matter of experience rather than a of description. As advised by Sri Guru 
Amar Dass Ji (3rd Sikh Guru), Sri Guru Ram Dass Ji (4th Sikh Guru) 
started the digging of Amrit Sarovar (Holy Tank) of Sri Harmandir Sahib in 
1577 A.D., which was later on brick-lined by Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji (5th Sikh 
Guru) on December 15, 1588 and He also started the construction of Sri
 Harimandir Sahib. Sri Guru Granth Sahib (scripture of the Sikhs), after its 
compilation, was first installed at Sri Harimandir Sahib on August 16, 
1604 A.D. A devout Sikh, Baba Budha Ji was appointed its first Head Priest.","Golden Temple Rd, Amritsar, Punjab 143006",0183 255 3957,"1. Amazing place to visit. The temple is so beautiful. It is insanely 
clean and people are ultra helpful in nature. A must see for 
everyone. Highly recommended to go sometime in the night, 
spend the night inside the temple and leave the next day morning
after the sunrise view",5,

difference out there, so peaceful, away from stress and other 
materialistic things which one can leave behind while entering the
 Gurdwara Sahib. Must see once in life.",4,
,,,,,,"4. Beautiful and peaceful place. You have to cover your head with 
any cloth before entering. And most important THE LANGAR 
which is really amazing to see how they cook so large amount of 
food for people and how they serve it. Food is very tasty in Langar 
and free of cost. Toilets are very very clean in temple. Good 
experience. :)

8,Sun Temple in Konark,,"One of the most stunning monuments of religious significance, a true 
masterpiece of architecture proudly stands in the form of Sun Temple at 
Konark. A culmination of Oriya architecture, the temple is a wonderful 
place as the language of stone defeats the human language here. Built in 
13th century by King Narasimhadeva, the temple is designed in the shape 
of a colossal chariot with seven horses and twelve wheels, carrying the 
sun god, Surya, across heavens. Located at a manageable distance from 
the seat of Lord Jagannath, Puri at 35 kms; the temple is around 65 kms 
from the capital city of Bhubaneswar. The name of Konark temple is an
 amalgamation of two words--Kona meaning corner and Arka meaning
 the Sun. That is to say that the Sun god worshipped in Ark Kshetra is 
called Konark. Legend says that after killing the demon Gyasur, Lord 
Vishnu placed his belongings at several places to commemorate the 
victory. With His conch at Puri, Disc in Bhubaneshwar and Mace in 
Jajapur; He placed the Lotus at Konark.","Konark, Odisha 752111",06758 236 821,"1. A historic Sun temple, built in the form of a chariot. Carved out 
of stone, with intricate stone work, it is a architectural
 technological and scientific wonder. The place is much ruined 
now and has no devotional ceremonies and is under restoration.
 Entry is on chargeable basis. Shoes are allowed, still 
photography is free. If on a sunny/rainy day, an umbrella is of
 much help. Taking a guided tour is recommended.",4,
,,,,,,"2. Visited Orissa during summer 1985. Visit to Sun Temple at 
Konarak is still green in our memory.  Architectural marvel. 
Engineering science at glorious heights even ceturies ago.",4,
,,,,,,"3. Lot of architecture is demolished already. But inspite    of that it 
is awesome. Don't miss  to see time on a sun dial. Needs better 
maintenance. Hot most of the  time in a year. ",3,
,,,,,,"4. Historic temple with magnificent work.  Surrounding is also 
nice and clean. But be aware of bees in the old temple. It can 
cause serious damage",3,

9,Dwarkadhish Temple Dwarka,,"Depending on who you are, what you are about to read can seem anything 
from myth to legend to reality. Turn back the cosmic clock, let your 
imagination plummet suddenly into 1500 BC, and you may begin to 
recreate in your mind’s eye, a city of gold – Dwarka, the mesmerizing 
kingdom of Lord Krishna. Ranchhodrai, as Lord Krishna is affectionately 
called in Gujarat, came to Dwarka from Mathura to build his new kingdom 
where he would later spend a significant part of his life. Located at the 
western tip of the Saurashtra peninsula, this town enjoys remarkable 
importance in Hindu lore. It is the only place considered both one of the 
four principal holy places (char dham), as well as one of the seven ancient
 towns (sapta puris) to visit. For this reason, millions of pilgrims and 
historical scholars have come here over the centuries.","Dwarka, Gujarat 361335",02892 234 080,"1. You have to walk past the narrow lanes which resembles old 
world to reach the spot. The temple complex houses a few tiny 
sanctums along with the main one of Lord Krishna. A good walk 
of 2 kms from the bus stop gives you ample opportunity to feel the 
nostalgia of one of oldest cities in the world.
",5,
,,,,,,"2. The temple is visited by us in month of july.The temple is very 
old and beautiful.The temple is always filled with devotees.You 
can also take bath in the Gomti river which is flowing near the
 temple.You should also taste Prasad after the Maha Aarti. ",3,
,,,,,,"3. This is the first temple that made me write such a negative 
review. I myself being a bhramin by caste, was amazed to see 
that when you enter a temple why do you get a bunch of bhramins 
ready to explain the temple history without even talking about 
Dakshina. There is a big reason behind it. The Pujaris are more 
interested in the Daan which counts in thousands. They ask you
 for doing this daan or that daan pricing in multiples of 2500/- 
They literally brainwash you saying it will help you in this way or
 that. So being religious is good but asking for so huge daan is
 not good.
",3,
,,,,,,"4. The place is known for the temple Bhagwan Krishna. Its one 
of the really sacred places of India. Located near the railway 
station of dwarka and transport to the temple is easily available. 
But, the cleanliness is not up to the mark. Must visit place if you're
 a believer.",4,

Observatory Hills of Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India. It was formerly the 
residence of the British Viceroy of India. It houses some of the most

construction started in 1880 and was completed in 1888. Lord Dufferin 
occupied the lodge on July 23, 1888","Boileauganj, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh 171005",,"1. A place of immense beauty and peace. You can get up their 
either by car or walking. I recommend walking because you get to
 experience the wondrous nature all around you. Normal people 
aren't allowed entry inside the building which sucks but is 
understandable because scholars study there.",3,
,,,,,,"2. The viceroy used to live here during British rule. One of most 
magnificent British era building. You can see lots of ancient things

(SAI meaning Sakshaat Ishwar) - GOD THE ABSOLUTE. This mysterious Fakir first made his appearance in Shirdi as a youth and remained there throughout his long life. He transformed the lives of those who met him and continuously is doing so even after his Samadhi in 1918 for those whose hearts are touched by his love and who pray and call him at any emergency in life for his blessings.Baba stated that his mission is to “Give Blessings” without discrimination to all, and he proves it in myriad ways by healing the sick, saving lives, protecting the vulnerable, averting accidents, granting offspring, facilitating financial gain, bringing people into harmony within themselves and with each other and, above all, in effecting the spiritual evolution and transformation of those who came to him as the last resort. Baba is, as one of his contemporary devotees put it, “The embodiment of the supreme spirit lighting the sadhakas (seekers') path by his every word and action”. To his devotees, Baba is nothing less than a God. This has been a matter of experience and not imaginary. “I look at all with an equal eye”","Tal.

more picturesque. The Thajiwas Glacier is located 3 kilometers from

accessible glaciers as one can easily walk to its base or reach there by 
hired ponies.Thajiwas Glacier is just half an hour walk from Sonamarg
 town. A motorable road takes you to the base of the glacier but the more
 popular mode of transport is by ponies. Like most tourists places, pony 
rides are overpriced at Rs. 500 or more for to and fro ride to the Glacier. 
The Thajiwas Glacier recedes as the summer progresses. By the time 
of my trip, it had dwindled in the vast valley and was confined to the gentle 
slopes, where the mountain begins. There were few camps and 
makeshift shops at the valley. Higher further, the Gujjars made their camp
 on either sides of the valley.","Forest Block, Jammu and Kashmir 191203",,"1. The first thing you notice in Sonmarg is the ice glaciers

 India. Situated in Uttar Pradesh, Agra is synonymous with the Taj Mahal 
however there’s lot more to the city than this world-famous monument. 
Right from the epic Mahabharata to the Mughal Dynasty, Agra has been 
monumental and has played a significant role in shaping India’s history. 
The city was first mentioned in Mahabharata as Agrevana which means
 the border of the forest. It was later established by Sikandar Lodi of the 
Lodi Dynasty in the sixteenth century who built many structures including 
forts, step wells, mosques, etc in Agra. He moved his capital from Delhi to
 Agra and after his death, his son ruled the city for nine years. Later, Sher 
Shah Suri ruled Agra and from 1556 to 1658 it was the capital of the 
Mughal Empire. Under the Mughal reign Agra was called Akbarabad and 
was ruled by greats like Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan, etc. Their love for 
architecture, gardens and art and culture added a new dimension to 
Agra’s personality. From Persian gardens on the banks of the Yamuna to
 monuments and mausoleums, Agra’s golden age started during their 
rule. It was after the decline of the Mughal Empire and during the reign of 
the Marathas that Akbarabad became Agra. By 1803, it came under the
 British Raj that remained strong for most part until India gained 
independence in 1947.","Agra, Uttar Pradesh 282001",,"1. It is worth watching as a piece of art and culture. But authorities

samabar hardly had any vegetables in it. The dry curry (palya)

 served palya we were mostly done Chapati. I am sorry to say that 
many other restaurants prepare much better food than this. ",,

and the view of the colossal Kanchenjunga with many other snow clad 
eastern Himalayan peaks from here, but we hardly talk about the summit

 peaks as the sun strikes is an awesome view, but Tiger Hill is great even 
otherwise. It's a destination by itself offering not just great views during 
sunrise, it's a place where you can soak yourself with Himalayan beauty 
anytime during the day.","Tiger Hill, West Bengal 734123",,"1. Don't do it -- hordes of people will hassle you and crowd you

Tiger hill to catch a glimpse of the Golden Kanchenjunga. The
 place is really crowded with tourists which created a lot of traffic, 
so we had to park the car midway and walk all the way up the hill
. The viewing area here was demolished recently to make way 
for a new one, so we ended up shuffling and jostling for space to
 have a good view of the mountain when the sun came up.
 However, due to the thick fog and cloud cover, no one could get a
 clear glimpse of the golden mountain which we came to know is
 the case on most days. Disappointed and sleepy, we headed 
down and proceeded to the rest of the sightseeing hoping to have
 a better day. ",3,

not had a camel ride experience before. Kids had a good time. ",3,

 take the car to the Pushkar lake! Thats a great view! ",3,

Varanasi. The Ganga Ghats at Varanasi are full of pilgrims who flock to the
 place to take a dip in the holy Ganges, which is believed to absolve one
 from all sins.There are number of temples on the bank of the Ganga river
 in Varanasi. It is believed that people are cleansed physically, mentally 
and spiritually at Ganga Ghats. It is at the Ganga Ghats where we see life 
and death together. For thousands of years people have been thronging 
these Ghats to offer their morning prayers to the rising sun. There are 
more than 100 ghats along side Ganga in Varanasi. Some of the
 prominent and popular Ghats at Varanasi are the Dasaswamedh Ghat,

words ""char"" and ""minar"" which is four towers. Now Let us talk about 
Some History of Char minar. First let me tell you that who built charminar
 and when?  the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty Sultan Muhammad 
Quli Qutb Shah built the Charminar in1591 century. After Shifting His 
capital from golkunda to Hyderabad He built this awesome structure of 
charminar. Because of charminar this landmark became a global icon of 
Hyderabad . Charminar is constructed in Islamic architecture. We can 
say that it is a signature of Islamic architecture. pulverised marble,
 limestone, mortar and  granite are used in structure of Charminar. It has
 a square structure of 20 * 20 meter size. Charminar contains four arches 
each of them opens in four streets. And because of these four grand 
arches it is named charminar. If you want to reach to upper floor then there 
are 149 winding steps for reach to upper floor.So friends this is the history

 love and care for every living being let alone human beings. And
 you will see everything opposite to the above - no equality there
 as people are sent in different queues, influence of money and
 power ... corruption at laddu counters as I was told that if I 
wanted more laddus I could have them provided I pay Rs.500 
extra ... utter disrespect for human beings in that stampede kind
 of mad rush. Now, people may say that people are bad, but
 God is good ...!! I believe that God does reside in such places. 
In any case, temples are created by men ... God resides everywhere.

to offer...the lobby the verandas the rooftop restaurant the pool
 area...and off course the decor of the rooms.....SUPERB ",4,

49,Nubra Valley Leh,,"Ladakh - the ‘Land of the High Passes’ - is among the most stunning parts 
of the Indian Himalayas. Wedged between Pakistan, Tibet and Xinjiang 
Province (China) and India’s Himachal Pradesh, it forms the eastern
 part of the contested state of Jammu & Kashmir. North of Leh, Ladakh’s 
‘capital’, lies a far-flung and austerely beautiful enclave cradled by rugged 
mountains ‒ this is the Nubra Valley (often simply abbreviated to Nubra), 
a tuft of land on the very scalp of India. Local communities once prospered
 on an extraordinary trans-Himalayan trade which originated with the Silk 
Road. Comprising huge mountains, yawning valleys and vast uninhabited
 hinterlands, most of Ladakh’s boundaries may look almost impenetrable
 on a map. Yet for centuries great caravans of wool and cloth, opium, 
spices and skins, coral and turquoise, gold and indigo negotiated
 several routes and their hazardous passes mainly between Leh and 
Yarkand (in China). The already withering trade finally died in the late 
1950s when China largely sealed its borders. After decades of obscurity
 peppered with geo-political spasms ‒ it remains a sensitive border area
 ‒ low-key tourism has gradually injected more visitors and money into 
Nubra. And as increasing numbers of tourists visit Ladakh each year, 
more are tempted to go the extra mile and come here.","Nubra Valley, 194401",,"1. This is one of the Attractions of Ladakh. It is very different from
the other parts of Ladakh as it has some vegetation and some
 cultivation here. The Main Attraction is the Sand (Cold Desert) 
where one can ride the double humped camels. The area is 
beautiful and one can sit and relax near the stream, take a short 
(15min) ride on the camels and watch the cultural show.
One can visit the Diskit Monestry and the Huge buddha statue 
near it. The view from the Statue area if worth the visit.
The Drive from Leh took about 51/2 hours via the Highest 
Motarable road in the world (Khardungla Pass at 18300 ft) 
which itself was breathtaking.
The overnight stay in Nubra is relaxing as travelling back to
 Leh would be too tiring.",4,
,,,,,,"2. The road trip was a great experience, you will find the good
 sand dunes in the valley. You can also see the double hump 
camel there. There is option for the ride too. Over all nice place 
and you must visit if you are in leh.

,,,,,,"3. The Blue water flows only in the winter and later until feb.
i have been in mid july unfortunately after rains.
Whenever it rains the water and river flows gets muddy and not a
 good scenery to watch.
I heard during monsoon and winter its frozen sometimes and
 looks all blue and scenic.
Nothing but sand dunes are there.
but what can you do it thats only place to go around ladakh.",3,
,,,,,,"4. A double humped camel ride and the sand dunes are what 
you get there. Must stay in a tent overlooking the mountains. was
 amazing. Though gets cold at night , days are warmer. ",,

50,Mussoorie,,"Perched on a ridge 2km high, the ‘Queen of Hill Stations’ vies with Nainital
 as Uttarakhand’s favourite holiday destination. When the mist clears, 
views of the green Doon Valley and the distant white-capped Himalayan
 peaks are superb, and in the hot months the cooler temperatures and 
fresh mountain air make a welcome break from the plains below. 
Established by the British in 1823, Mussoorie became hugely popular 
with the Raj set. The ghosts of that era linger on in the architecture of the
churches, libraries, hotels and summer palaces. The town is swamped 
with visitors between May and July, when it can seem like a tacky holiday 
camp for families and honeymooners, but at other times many of the 300 
hotels have vacancies and their prices drop dramatically. During monsoon, 
the town is often shrouded in clouds. Central Mussoorie consists of two
 developed areas: Gandhi Chowk (also called Library Bazaar) at the western
 end, and the livelier Kulri Bazaar and Picture Palace at the eastern end,
 linked by the 2km Mall, which is still dominated by pedestrians but has
 sadly seen a notable increase in vehicle traffic and noise. Beyond Kulri 
Bazaar a narrow road leads 1.5km to Landour Bazaar.","The Mall Road, Mussoorie, Uttarakhand",,"1. Hi people this is exclusively for the people planning to visit
 musoorie this monsoon, please think twice you'll definitely 
get to see a foggy weather but trust me you'll not be able to 
enjoy the rain there as its going to get too messy. its better if you 
visit some other hill staion, musoorie use to be very good 
tourist attraction sometime back but now its the other way
 around its so dirty so do not even plan especially in monsoon's.",3,
,,,,,,"2. Musoorie is a place to be visited in winters keeping in mind that 
you have prior hotel booking so that you donot keep hunting for 
hotel rooms, you can get to see amazing crowd and celebration
 in xmas or new year but without a prior booking in hotel you'll 
enjoyment will be vanished because its freezing there in winters
 so keep a plan aside for winters if musoorie is in your list.",3,
,,,"
",,,"3. Nice place. Weather is grt. Main attraction is mall road main 
market. Best for shopping and street food. ",3,
,,,,,,"4. As the name describes""masooroe -the queen of hills"".it is really
 a wonderful place to explore.one must go there and explore the
 beauty of nature, the wonderful scenery it has.you will find many 
wonderful places while going upside. ",4,
