The doctor there straightaway suggested surgery without any kind of physiotherapy. Thanks to my Yoga instructor my shoulder is fully cured. Hospitals like Fortis and all kind of institutionalised healthcare professionals do not believe in addressing the cause, rather focus on making money for the hospital. Eventually in the broad room meeting it is the balance sheet that matters.",1,

The challenge of the early days was enormous, to foster the fledgling hospital into an enduring symbol of healthcare in the country. We recognised early on, that to make a real and substantial contribution, one had to redefine the standards themselves, instead of doing more of the same. That set the tone of our endeavour and guided us every step of the way, luring us towards ambitious solutions, services, teamwork and quality that suited us.

The results were quick to show. In 2007 we became the first hospital in Western India to receive the prestigious NABH Accreditation for Hospitals and Healthcare providers, an honour accorded to only eight hospitals in the country at the time. The IMC Ramakrishna Bajaj National Quality Award trophy, for excellence in healthcare, followed in 2008. In 2009, we were the proud recipients of the coveted International Asia Pacific Quality Award (The Malcolm Baldridge Award) as it is known outside in the United States.It is an established fact that at the heart of the Hiranandani mission, in any sector, is the passionate commitment to stay at par with global standards. Predictably, the theme reflects on nearly everything we undertake at the Hospital ‚Äì the first initiative of the Hiranandani Group in healthcare. From the simplest to the most complex surgical; procedures are performed at our hospital.  We are equipped with medical equipment purchased from the foremost vendors in the world.
