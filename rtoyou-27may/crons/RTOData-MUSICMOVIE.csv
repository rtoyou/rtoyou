Saavan is the best, you guys Rock!!! - this was till about 1 month ago. Now saavan wants $5 per month for average playlist, spotty functionality, and music you can download but not export! In contrast I pay Netflix $9 /month for an amazing collection of movies... Figure out a better pricing model Saavan, or your 18 million subscribers will become 18 thousand!!!",2,
,,,,2.  I have purchased an year long premium subscription and at this point in time i feel my money would have been better spent if I would have fed it to a goat. English music library is garbage. Nothing but the most mainstream music is available. And dont think about downloading more than a 100 songs cause one day the app will crash and you will loose all of it. Swear to god the day spotify comes to india all of these morons are gonna go out of business.,1,
,,,,"3. Its good for listeing songs online and it is quit well organised. But it consist lots of advertisment which is somtimes irritating. Even its downloading function is also not that amazing. But yes, it have a awesome collection of songs as compared to other such apps.",4,
,,,,"4. This is a great music app and the podcasts are also very good, especially Cyrus Says. A problem I am facing is that I am unable to create playlists with my downloaded songs. The app auto-arranges all downloaded songs in alphabetical order and there is no option to edit the order of songs. Thanks for the feature where you can select the quality of the streaming audio. With this, the audio works even on 2G network. I don't think any other podcast or music app provides this option. Overall, great app.",5,

Like- Exclusive albums, good audio quality

Dislike- Website is bit heavy, User interface can be improved, many new songs not available, lots of ads(if u want ad free experience upgrade to premium packs)

My experience of using this site was good but you need to have a good connection for this. Support team at Gaana was very helpful.",3,
,,,,"3. Revising ratings to reflect continuous improvement in content, quality, UI, speed of download and most importantly acting on feedback. To that effect another feedback: Subscribers are already paying for your content, so instead of caching the files in a hidden folder and using numerological nomenclature why not allow us to carry the music where ever we want with the album artwork and names of songs intact? You may see higher sales! Game?",1,
,,,,"4. Nice collection and hence I paid for full year subscription. I have downloaded many songs. Now if I try to play them the message comes "" unfortunately gaana stopped.

-organizes music in an easy format (like several other available programs)

Cons
-takes up a lot of space 
-difficult to uninstall

Summary
I expected better.",1,
,,,,"2. Pros
Music organization. Only way (thanks Apple) to load music on my $50 iPod Shuffle.

Cons
Runs like it's built for Windows 95. Automatically sets itself to open on startup with every update. Updates come about once a week. It only updates after a restart. PC restart can take up to 10 minutes. And then you have to go in MSCONFIG to turn iTunes back off. Every, single, time.

Summary
Apple obviously wants you to buy Apple everything. It puts me in awe to see so many falling for it. iTunes works just fine on Apple products, surprise surprise. How this isn't illegal, I have no idea.",1,
,,,,"3. Pros
It manages songs and videos and it plays them properly. You can sync different devices but it's hard to manage multiple devices or multiple computers. I use it fairly often.

Cons
It's not the best. After each new update there are bugs and often they don't fix bugs from the last update. It's pretty glitchy but it works.

Summary
It's okay but it could be a *lot* better.",3,
,,,,"4. Pros
Individual songs are not that expensive.
Easy to use.
Has a wide selection on the store.

Cons
Froze up my computer one time.
Can take a long time to load up.

About 90% of my friends have the same issues, and I presume it's those who have an updated version of the app. Curious to know if this is a side effect of trying to improve streaming?

Lost a star as version 7 homepage really is an astonishingly ugly mess. All other screens have space around art.

,,,,"2.  The radio feature is very good, but when you try to make your own playlists and change the order of songs on them, it usually reverts or partially reverts it when it syncs. I've reordered songs and literally seconds later, before my very eyes they switch back to how they used to be. Needless to say this is very frustrating. (I'm using a Galaxy S6 Edge)",3,

Plus there's no way to turn off the persistent notification, so now I have to have it taking up space on my notification bar. I just want it to run in the background.",1,
,,,,"2. It scrobbles only the first song played. What is the point, then? Actually, this behavior occurs whenever a bluetooth speaker is used - only the first song is scrobbled. If the music is played on the phone itself or with headphones, no problem. Unfortunately, I use bluetooth speakers A LOT - by my bed, in the car, on my bike. For the record, I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7 phone, android 6 (Marshmallow), scrobbling from Google Music app.",3,
,,,,"3. Minimal, Lazy Effort Really, all it does is scrobble. You can't even hit the love button on a recent track unless it was recorded by the app itself. It really serves no purpose for me as a lot of music players will scrobble on their own. And it doesn't even do that well either - there are toggles to disable for certain players (e.g. Spotify), disabling does nothing and you end up with double scribbles anyway. Frustrating. Will be installing a third party app instead...",2,

Now instead of taking me to the station it takes me to an artist bio +top hits list page. If I needed that, I wouldn't have the artist as my favorite already!!

This show needs more recognition what it deserves. The trademark dialogues like ""Sahi pakde hain"" , ""I like it"" are well timed. The Angoori Bhabhiji's Bhojpuri lines inspires us also to use it. The two day story also works well. The lead actors as well as supporting actors are very talented. Each character is very well written. What works well is the comedy is very well timed. Anita's modern women character is delightful. Angoori's innocent nature is loved by all. Vibhooti's style is hilarious, Tiwari's expressions are funny.

Talking about writer and cast, each cast is doing a great and wonderful acting. Hats off to writer for Putting all their effort to make us laugh without involving any vulgar or dual meaning jokes. All characters has their own identity because of which we love their acting and very much different from each other.

Protagonist Ritik Raheja (Arjun Bijlani) is a rich businessman (yawn) who has to get married before he turn 25 to avoid a glitch in his horoscope. Otherwise engrossed with his phone and laptop, Ritik's heart warms instantly to snake woman Shivanya ( Mouni Roy) posing as a poor maid at his palace. His Father, Ankush Raheja (ManishKhanna) gets facials, pumps iron and manhandles his wife to seem scary. Mommy Yamini (Sudha Chandran) spends time with priests and astrologers trying to appease them into forgetting her husband's snake killing past. Arjun Bijlani tries in vain to make his character interesting, and while the man is easy on the eye there is very little he can work with. Sudha Chandran tries earnestly to breathe life into her role but her flashlight bindis are more interesting than her role. Manish Khanna father is suitably evil looking and has rather reptilian eyes but needs to be told that acting cool or scary is not acting. The saaging supporting cast includes drinks a lot sister, nerd cousin, and other folks who don't contribute in any way to taking the story forward. In the middle of this mess is another Naagin (Adaa Khan) who serves as a red herring in the first couple of episodes but it's not quite clear whom she has her fangs set on. There is no emotional connect with any of the main cast and 5 episodes into the show, one can't wait for the killing to start to save us from watching their expressionless faces.",,1. We didn’t want to watch karanveer as Rocky….he. Will be replaced by someone..And most of all Arjun is the right choose …please cast Arjun as Rocky….,1,

,,,,"3. Trangender has nothing to do with the genitals, rather it''s to do with whether a person feels that they have the or female behaviour and characteristics that society claims are essential for a person to be identified as being male or female. if a person feels they do not conform to these standards set by society and don''t feel like the gender they are on the outside then they may choose to adopt the characteristics of the gender they feel they relate to the most. For example a male may feel more feminine then masculine and hence may want to be identified as a female instead. But these idiots and you guys yourselves have no idea about all the terminology. I understand kinner is a umbrella term for all the sub-categories but why use the term transgender to translate the term kinner in to english when that is inaccurate especially considering the way the story is portraying transgenders.",4,

First of all I would like to say this serial was one of my favorite when ruhi was a little kid and the chemistry between raman and ishita has been started but right now I really feel that it is the worst serial and star plus should stop this serial with a really good THE END episode where everyone is happy including shagun.,1,
,,,,"3. Yeh hai mohbaatein has completed more than 2 years on tv and I m 100% sure that this show has never shown a single episode without nonsense in it.

This show is pure nonsense whether its story or direction or what not.

The story of the daily soap is fixed.there is a female lead and she will save her whole family from the evil strategy of the villains and in every 10-12 days this is the story that circulates but everytime in a new packet.

One thing about show that goes in favor is that the perfamnce are decent and watchable but other than that it is a pure torture",2,

I don't want to wait for the next episode I want to see the whole series at a time. it's a great punishment for me to wait for the next episode and to wait to see the chemistry between Pragya and Abhi I just love this serial and wanted to see more episodes,5,

Now a days abhi lost her memory of two and half year and this is irritating. What the story wants to prove nobody can understand. Some comic event are interesting.

Sony","The Kapil Sharma Show is an Indian Hindi stand-up comedy and talk television series which premiered on 23 April 2016 and is broadcast by Sony TV. The series revolves around Kapil Sharma and his neighbors in the Shantivan Non-cooperative Housing Society.

Development began in December 2015, when Sharma announced his plans to create a new show for a Hindi general-entertainment channel other than Colors TV. The series received mixed reviews; one critic said, ""Kapil Sharma’s wit and funny one-liners bring a smile"", but another called it ""dull and disappointing"". It has received positive feedback from audiences, gaining top TRP ratings in the non-fiction category.The series' format is largely identical to that of Comedy Nights with Kapil. The Kapil Sharma Show revolves around Sharma and his team of comedians, including Kiku Sharda, Sunil Grover, Sumona Chakravarti, Chandan Prabhakar and Ali Asgar, who play residents of the Shantivan Non-cooperative Housing Society. Each episode features Bollywood celebrities, who usually promote their latest film, and joke with the cast. Navjot Singh Sidhu plays a judge who impresses the celebrities with his poetries.",,"1. The jokes are simply not funny. I kept wondering what the audience is laughing for. Perhaps, the audience is paid to laugh. The script is poorly written. Of 20 jokes cracked, one might find 0- 1 joke funny. Rest all get laughs for no reason. ",1,

The show is based on the happenings of a society named Gokuldham. It is based on the day to day life of its members. The society members are from different Indian cultures & communities and still they live together in peace and harmony. They celebrate festivals with each other. There are lots of characters on the show & every character is unique and funny. The story revolves around the Jethalal and his family. There is a kids party called as Taapu Sena. The thing i love in this show is, it teach us how different religions people can live together in peace. Laugh and Learn... Totally Recommended..",5,
,,,,"2. First of all, the comedy content is somewhere lost in the show.. And all credit goes to madam Daya ( daya Karo ab Tum) and Tapu Sena.. Don't know why Asit Modi is so relying on silly Daya when there are so many talented characters in the show such as Bhide, Sodhi Baha'i, Iyer, popatlal and of course jetha with Babuji.. There has been a huge transformation in the show, earlier the content used to be a hilarious ride along with a social message.. And every story was linked to the other one.. However now they keep on annoying us with Daya and her irritating voice with weird faces.. I hate her.. They should stop dragging the show in order to make record of episodes and should start writing some good comedy episodes.. Even the direction has gone poor.. Earlier it used to be a stress buster but now the show has started giving us stress and irritation.. Please do something about it otherwise please wind up the show.. Humble request..",1,
,,,,"3. Very disappointed as daily viewer of this show. I know, I started watching this show in early 2011. That time this was my Favorited show. But day by day they are decreasing their quality of comedy. They are loosing the charm of comedy. Earlier episode of Jetha and Babita was very funny ever. But from the year 2014 to still in 2015 director Asit modi and Character of Tarak Mehta (Shailesh lodha) thinks people are fool, & they will watch what we show to him, this was seen when Daya's mother was not came in the serial, audience was made fool when Daya's mother was going to come but really she didn't came in the serial. They also thinks, We can make people fool easily by showing third class quality of written all last 300 episodes. Sense of humour is lacking in all last episodes. I will request all loyal viewers to don't watch this worst Daya's centered show. The worst character of this show. Please increase your quality to make viewers happy.",1,
,,,,"4. I don't understand Hindi much, but this serial WAS amazing. Story, Action and everything WAS amazing (till 2013/or 2014). I did not see this kind of clean comedy anywhere. English Sitcoms are also amazing, but they are mostly based on Adult content.

Since one year, the quality has been degrading, very much.

If they don't improve it, the viewer-ship will RAPIDLY be going down. And coming to Male or Female domination, we should think this is just for fun. There are Female dominated/oriented families (Ayyar and Babitha, Madhavi and Bhide), so we can not point out this. Overall, this was amazing and hilarious serial. But now, everything is very very boring. Direction, Story, Action, Settings, and even the camera as well.",5,

They told the media that they wanted to give chance to the new generation to carry forward the show and they have done enough to popularise the show.The auditions of this reality TV show were conducted by popular VJ's like Raghu Ram, Nikhil Chinapa and Rajiv Laxman. From 12th season onwards, the auditions are conducted by Rannvijay Singh, Vijender Singh, Karan Kundra and Esha Deol.

Presentation, background music, cinematography, acting all the components are very good. It shows the real problems in the society. However I feel the violence which are no far from reality shown in such a manner which makes unacceptable to many viewers. If the violence shown is edited to some extent it can be acceptable to larger number of viewers. It has brought a number of burning issues of the society. No daily soap or crime show can create such good influence. My wishes are with this show.",5,

Crime patrol is the only show that caught my attention and never fails to entertain me with its interesting direction and realistic feel. Despite all the drama,they still manage to get the message across to the audience. It is also helping the Indian audience(rural and urban) in understanding how the police functions and investigates locally. The narration of Anup Soni is also unmatchable and heartfelt.I find the suspense part also equally good. People arguing that it is a negative show must understand that these things do happen in the real world and little dramatization never hurts anybody. All in all,one of my favorite shows to watch on TV,and the only show I watch on Indian TV.",3,

The film was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the southern state of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198 minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204 minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than five years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. By some accounts, Sholay is the highest grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation.

The film drew heavily from the conventions of Westerns, and is a defining example of the masala film, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of India's daily vernacular. In January 2014, Sholay was re-released to theatres in the 3D format.",Ramesh Sippy,"1. This movie is just the best movie i have seen. (I have watched around 570 movies) (Its my favorite movie).It has all the elements that a good movie must have:

Excellent Dialogues.

Excellent Music.

Excellent Acting. (Even the extra's where excellent)

Excellent Story/Plot.

Good Songs.",4,
,,,,"2. If you liked ""Once upon a time in the west"", ""The magnificent seven"" and ""A fistful of dollars"", you will love ""Sholay"". It takes all the good ingredients of a western, spices it with a lot of Indian ingredients and lets it simmer until you get one of the finest ""curry"" westerns imaginable. Though obviously very much inspired by the ""spaghetti"" westerns of the late 1960s/early 1970s, this easily surpasses most of the films it's modeled after. A masterpiece.",5,
,,,,3. an't find a single flaw in the movie. Probably one of the best ever made in Hindi. The camera work is flawless and grips you. The acting is inspired. The music is memorable. One of the movies you remember for life.,4,
,,,,4. This is one movie which is flawless. Great performances from everyone. The cast of the movie is just perfect. Gabbar's character remains indelibly etched on your mind once you've seen him in action. Amitabh is definitely one of the greatest actors of all times. His portrayal of a criminal with morals is all the way tops along with Brando's Vito Corleone. I think the part about cheating with false coin to save Viru's life (sacrificing his own) was a lovely storyteller's touch. 10 all the way!,4,

30,Comedy Night Bachao Colors,"As the name says, Comedy nights Bachao is an Indian comedy series telecasted one day in a week. In the show, the comic crusaders take a jibe of those who came in their show as a guest by insulting and taking the fun of him and testing their patience by cracking some unpleasant jokes on the celebrity guest. TRP ratings of popular t.v comedy serial comedy nights Bachao had been rapidly increased. Comedy nights Bachao has been aired on colors t.v every Sunday and was getting a great trp. Comedy nights Bachao is an entertaining show to the good extent but still the makers of the show are in fear with the popularity of the Kapil Sharma show.",,1. INITIALLY THIS SHOW DID WELL BECAUSE THAT TIME THERE WAS NOTHING TO WATCH BUT AS SOON AS KALIP SHARMA SHOW STARTED IT STARTED GOING DOWN. THIS SHOW HAS BRILLIANT ACTORS BOT STILL SHOW IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE BECAUSE OF THE SHOW ITSELF. THE WORST PART OF THIS SHOW IS ITS PLOT. AND COMEDY PUNCHES ARE ALSO VERY SAD. AFTER PUTTING SO MUCH OF EFFORTS BY ACTORS THIS FOR  ME IS SHOULD SHUT DOWN. WE CAN ENJOY SOMETHING ELS INSEAD OF THIS SHOW. I WISH CHANEL ALSO UNDERSTAND THIS,2,
,,,,"2. Comedy Night Bachao is best best comedy show on Earth.I have watched all episodes.Concept of this show is wonderfull, unthinkable, I never expected before that this type of show we'll See.In Comedy Nights Bachao Celebrities come as guest and Casts of this show was play live acts.All Casts of this show was too talented.Krishna and Bharti are host of this show.Krishna and bharti are really very talented and they are doing very hardwork.Ada khan, karan and all Casts very talented.Sudesh is too good.I love his mimicry and video dubbing.In one sentence Comedy Nights Bachao is greatest Show in India and World also. NK",4,
,,,,"3. Poor jokes, lame comedy and insulting guests is what you will find in this show. Krushna and Bharti's overconfident acts is not at all entertaining. There is nothing to laugh. You may become furious instead. Colors should stop this show immediately and should come up with something better.",1,
,,,,4. Its just a boring show which disappoint you. It has just boring concept of inviting the guests and insulting them by making there fun with really worse jokes. I dont think that this show would be continue for a longer time. It is just making fun of personalities. So this is my review about this mindburning show.,1,

32,Aap ka Surroor(Album),"Call it a sequel to the chartbusting album Aap Ka Surroor - which rewrote history in music sales for a pop album in India. This soundtrack of Himesh Reshammiya’s debut movie is ubiquitous in all corners of the world. A brand in the making since the release of the music of ‘Aashiq Banaya Aapne’, the composer who has so far already essayed the role of a producer (TV Serials), composer and singer is back with a bang in business, with tunes targeted for the masses.
Messiah and Reshammiya were synonymous when producers of small budget movies saw rushes for their projects when the music caught on wildly with the masses. Promotional videos were being shot at brisk rate to secure box office success and the composer was featured in the videos, holding the mike in the cool-n-stylish manner. Termed as a hurricane in 2006, in terms of the never-seen-before storm created in the music charts since the arrival of the new millennium, Himesh Reshammiya’s name was on everyone’s lips and mind. Frenzy is an under-statement when his own music videos from his album were first aired. So much happened that acting was the next phase in his brand building. The awareness phase was over and proved to be the biggest hit of the brand building strategy. Charged with more energy, the team of Reshammiya-Sameer-Chadha are back to rock the world.

An air of aggressiveness is felt in the voice of Himesh Reshammiya in Assalaam Vaalekum– a loud voice is heard which reaches high notes and is quite rough in the rendering. Does the situation require vengeance? The rap genre is aptly mixed with Urdu words and add to that, the Reshammiya brand of music, which extracts sounds from soft rock to industrial-techno genres. The macho mood is confirmed with the male chorus supporting the singer while the rap portions infuse a certain break in this incomprehensible act of agitation in the singing. Lack of simplicity combined with the heavy pressure on the vocals, relegate the track to an average position.",Himesh Reshammiya,1. Himesh reshamiya is the very good looking man and his songs is always awesome. his all song lyks by youth. himesh reshamiya is the wonderfull icon of music industry. In the field of music he is one of the greatest and iconic person. his music touch all youth's heart. aapka suroor song is one of the best song who lyk by every youth. this song is the base of movie. So I can say thathimesh reshamiya songs is really wonderfull.,4,
,,,,"2. Reshammiya greets listeners with'Assalaam Vaalekum', a stage song where Reshammiya does what he is best at i.e. wear his trademark attire, bring mike close to his mouth and croon with an undisputed energy which is always witnessed when he is front of a live audience. A song in appreciation of the woman he loves, it is one of those rare Reshammiya numbers that takes more than just a couple of times to catch up on you.",3,
,,,,"3. Back in 2007, Himesh Reshammiyamade Aap Ka Suroor which was a musical blockbuster thatalso gave Hansika Motwani her first big break. Aap Ka Suroor was entertaining because Himesh didn’t take himself seriously and we got to enjoy some foot tapping tunes. Nine years later, the singer turned actor is back with Tera Suroor which is loosely based in concept on its predecessor but has better production values, lavish locales and a new girl(Farah Karimaee) opposite Himesh.",3,
,,,,"4. One of the hittest of its times, HImesh Reshammiya made a good debut in the world of music. I used to buy this music because there were lots of songs sung by him which was really awesome and fantastic. This music categorized into different songs which was hit every where. The songs were superb and and the lyrics and music was outstanding.

There was a style of keeping caps and it became a trend for the youths . The music was totally different from others and after a long time new style of songs were heard which makes him a superstar all around in the Bollywood.",4,

33,The Jangle Book,"Abandoned after an accident, baby Mowgli is taken and raised by a family of wolves. As the boy grows older, the wise panther Bagheera realizes he must be returned to his own kind in the nearby man-village. Baloo the bear however thinks differently taking the young Mowgli under his wing and teaching that living in the jungle is the best life there is. Bagheera realizes that Mowgli is in danger, particularly from Shere Khan the tiger who hates all people. When Baloo finally comes around, Mowgli runs off into the jungle where he survives a second encounter with Kaa the snake and finally, with Shere Khan. It's the sight of a pretty girl however that gets Mowgli to go the nearby man-village. Disney animation inspired by Rudyard Kiplings ""Mowgli"" story. Mowgli is a boy who has been raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. When the wolves hear that the fierce tiger, Shere Kahn, is nearby, they decide to send Mowgli to a local ""man tribe"". On his way to the village, Mowgli meets many animal characters in this musical tale. When Shere Kahn learns of Mowgli's presence, he tracks him down. ",Jon Favreau,"1. Raised by a family of wolves since birth, Mowgli (Neel Sethi) must leave the only home he's ever known when the fearsome tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) unleashes his mighty roar. Guided by a no-nonsense panther (Ben Kingsley) and a free-spirited bear (Bill Murray), the young boy meets an array of jungle animals, including a slithery python and a smooth-talking ape. Along the way, Mowgli learns valuable life lessons as his epic journey of self-discovery leads to fun and adventure.

Disney Picture is the best company in making top and number 1 family movies.

Everything is excellent about this movie.

I guarantee you this top movie will win too many Oscars. ",4,
,,,,"2. A great remake that will definitely enchant kids and adults. The CGI characters are excellent and there is an entertaining atmosphere of humor, adventure and suspense.

Mogwli is a Lost boy in the Jungle,but has been grown up the animals - Bagera(Panther), Rakhsha(Wolf mother), Baloo (Bear). Soon Mogwli realizes that since he is human he needs to live with humans.Yet,he can not abandon his loyal Animals who have already taken care of him since he was a baby.

""The Jungle Book"" 2016 has a different,but an amazing ending than ""The Jungle Book"" 1967.I can guarantee that you will see a perfect movie with Great Graphics IMAX Effect and The Best 3D I Have Ever Seen.

I really estimate Disney for their support of Lesbian and Gays.Disney is Simply The Best. ",4,
,,,,"3. The movie may have shown a lot of similarities to the old cartoon,but it didn't show enough info or relationship with Mowgli and the wolves. Sure they did the story good with Mowgli and Baloo's relationship,but what it also rushed through was the ending,and plus I didn't like it when Mowgli went to the man village. The fight with the tiger in the cartoon wasn't bad,but the movie just made it 10 times better. The 1967 one was classic,but the movie just made it into the best thrilling and emotional story that even I enjoyed. I mean yes I wouldn't really make reviews for kids movies,but the director was the man who made Iron man and I love marvel. So I checked out this movie,I watched it and I was like ""oh my god...this was amazing."" So it was just in my opinion,better than the original. The original is in my second place. ",3,
,,,,"4. This seems to be one of those movies you either loved or hated, based on what I read on the reviews. I liked it. It featured outstanding visual effects and a great voice cast, including the great songs like The Bare Necessities. My favorite scenes were where they were in King Louie's temple, the elephant scene, and the showdown scene with the tiger. Christopher Walken, Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, and Idris Elba were great in their parts. Whether you're familiar with the classic story or new to it, you will enjoy this movie. I liked the kid as Mowgli. Kids might like it more than adults though.",3,

Udaan is a social message program to highlight the issue of bonded labour in Indian villages.",Mahesh Bhatt,1. Udaan is a most boring and irritating show .The two sisters are really goddess . Chakor need to lose her weight . She didnot really looks like a main character but a horrible looking woman .These unsense able shows are really abig weight on the bollywood industry . I hope its end comes near and a new senseable and interesting show comes.,1,
,,,,"2. Udaan is coming on colors.In starting I loved to watch this serial because acting of small girl who play the role of chakor was wonderful .In starting this serial is nice .I never miss the episode .This serial show the story of a girl who want to do something big in her life even she is a slave .She want to free every person from the clutches of kamalnarayan.She free herself and become a good runner.Till then it is good but know this serial is really very boring.chakore get married , villagers were again in trouble.Main theme of udaan is disappear somewhere.wastage of time know.",2,
,,,,3. In this serial starting how chakor was struggling for her life and she was very strong personality I like this character very much now also chakor is very strong and main character in the story. I like this story and here we can understand by seeing this story how people struggle in some poor villages in India. in the end of the story what will going to happen to kamal narayan I am very curious about this villan character.,4,
,,,,"4. This is a famous colors t.v show, in this a sweet girl named Chakor acts as main lead role.

as on my point of view this show was much better before, this time when I personally watch is show I felt bored. because this show is too old now the main characters are not doing as good as they was doing before. I specially dislike the creativity of this time in the show I mean I do not like the way they are presenting their show. If they make this show so interesting then this show will take much TRP than present scenario. I want something change. this show needs some twist.",2,
,,,,"5. As this show is starting with a very good concept of how a girl which is slave, is ran away and make her dream of becoming athlete.

This show maintain its concept around 3 to 4 months and after that it goes in wrong direction like other shows.

Now they show us their household stories which I think is waste of time.

So this show is now not worthy to watch.",1,
