 courtyard has become a tranquil haven away from the bustle of Jodhpur’s old town. The hotel comprises four original buildings 
with three additional contemporary structures, influenced by and contributing to its cultural past as part of the Walled City. The new 
buildings are modern and contemporary in their use of space and light; and yet grounded in tradition. Indeed, each of its structures 
is adorned with intricate architectural carvings in the iconic Haveli style of the 18th century, juxtaposed against modern designs and
 patterns. Jodhpur's red sand-stone unites the new with the old, as modern designs add an exciting and fresh dimension to the 
region's age-old stone carving industry. The magnificent pol, along with the staff quarters and guardhouse, makes a stunning entry 
to the hotel.

 considered one of the prime responsibilities of those in power. In the late nineteenth century, Thakur Chhatra Singh of Nimaj, a
 powerful noble of the desert kingdom of Marwar (Jodhpur), decided to dam a seasonal stream flowing through his estate. His
 vision was to create a water reservoir which would harvest the monsoon rains. It was an ambitious project and a great drain on
 his resources but Thakur Chhatra Singh remained true to his vision. The dam was completed in 1890 and changed the dry scrub 
into prime agricultural land. Farmers struggling for sustenance on parched lands were invited by Thakur Chhatra Singh to settle 
around the reservoir.","Village and Post Office Nimaj,, District Pali, Rajasthan 306303",02939 230 118,"1. Chhatra Sagar has developed into a lush green oasis near a man-made dam. With it’s
